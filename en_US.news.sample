The first is the love of self and the second, the love of money. Two Greek words, philautos and philargyros, succinctly express these concepts. Both, I detect, lie at the root of the world's problems. Certainly, this diagnosis is not novel. Why then are these destructive personality traits chronic in the human experience? Further, why are people who possess these attributes permitted to run rampant through communities and societies to the detriment of the greater population? The Protester seeks to curb the second phenomenon.

Though Maryland is the wealthiest state in the country, all Maryland's children are not equal. Maryland is not exempt from the conditions that allowed the Trayvon Martin tragedy to occur. Our battle for equity for all of our children is not just against individuals, it is against established systems and institutions.

There are health disparities in infant mortality and low-birthweight babies. There are educational disparities in academic achievement and disparate administering of school discipline policies such as suspensions, expulsions, and school-based arrests. There are child welfare system disparities that show children of color being removed from home at higher rates than their white counterparts. There are juvenile justice system disparities at every stage from arrest to placement to youth being tried as adults.

A: I think it was absolutely right. What happened with King Crimson is that Ian McDonald and Mike Giles decided that they didn't want to go touring anymore. They decided they just wanted to make records in the studio. And so, they left King Crimson. That was it. The band was over. Now, we could have replaced two people, but I just didn't feel it was right. Ian and Mike were so important in that band. I said to Robert (Fripp) at the time, "I'll form a new band if you like. But I just don't feel right about carrying on the name King Crimson.
In accusing Adams of failing to live up to his commitment, Cogen cites a letter Adams sent in May 2009 to then-County Chairman Ted Wheeler. In it, Adams commits to a city contribution for the bridge project of $8 million a year for 20 years.

Eurama cautions her against prizing the fabric over the person, a lesson that doesn't quite land, even when McKinley is swept into mourning at an indigo-tinged funeral when Eurama's husband dies. After this, McKinley continues to collect in weighty encounters successive fabrics, traveling along roads and through outposts that she notes were built for imperial extraction. McKinley's description of indigo's history, which often arises as overly deliberate exposition, is best when it appears like this, as it is — underfoot, in the air. Her most difficult procurement comes in the middle of an attempted coup in the Ivory Coast, where she sees herself mirrored in an upper-class African woman carrying, amid chaos over control of wealth, a Chanel purse: "I'm just like her; I'm unable to give up the ghost of the things I hope will fill me with meaning."

TRENTON — A city resident convicted of sexually assaulting his girlfriend’s two little girls was sentenced to 34 years in prison Thursday.
Santorum didn’t. He overthought. He overcorrected. He overdid. He spent so much time explaining the process by which he voted for this, or why he’d originally done that, and the difficulty in his position that led him to do the other, that he never made a positive case for himself.
For the rest of the runners, though, the race was a chance to dress up, join with thousands of friends, old and new, and spend a morning of revelry sweating shoulder-to-shoulder on the city pavement.

Mr. Malouf, who is on his third heart (his first transplant was in 1989 and what he hopes was his last in 2003), says more changes at Petersham are likely; he is working with existing kitchen staff and wants to hire people who are at least as good or better than he is to get through the transition.

But what's most amazing about "American Reunion" is its absolute lack of tonal control.

"The fact is," says Yuval Levin of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, "Medicare is going to crush the government, and if Republicans leave it unreformed then the debt picture is very, very ugly. They might never -- literally never -- show the budget reaching balance. Not in the 10-year window and not if they take their graphs out 100 years. Obama could probably show balance just past the budget window in the middle of the next decade because of the massive Medicare cuts he proposes, even if in practice they will never actually happen."

The same, of course, could be said of narrative, which is, at the most basic level, an attempt to impose order on the chaos of experience. That adds another layer of tension to the collection, since stories need some kind of resolution even when what they record is unresolved. For the most part, Doerr does an excellent job of balancing these intentions, creating work that is open-ended yet nuanced, avoiding false connections or epiphanies. The narrator of "The River Nemunas," a teenage girl who moves from Kansas to Lithuania to live with her grandfather after her parents die of cancer, learns that it never gets easier, that the pain of absence is perhaps the only thing that doesn't dissipate. "Lots of things fade away," she thinks, "but ghosts like these don't, heartbreak like this doesn't."

Strangely, the shift in the tight game came courtesy of two huge three-pointers by Holiday in the fourth quarter. With the Sixers leading, 74-73, and Holiday having made only six of 21 shots, the third-year guard rose from 27 feet with the confidence he always seems to have.

Like the two previous films about the CGI rodents with the helium singing voices, "Chipwrecked" falls well short of the bar for wink-wink postmodernism set by "Shrek." But it does make surprisingly inoffensive viewing for adults, who will find the semi-sly references to Sarah Palin and "You Got Served" a welcome distraction from the hackneyed plot, which sees the three Chipmunks and their girl-group counterparts, the Chipettes, marooned on a desert island complete with active volcano, hidden treasure and a savage native (a snarling honey badger).

With Ruvo as their host, Cosgrove, along with his wife, Anita, and a handful of other Clinic executives, found themselves as welcomed members of the Las Vegas scene at this year's gala -- it's a scene that Cosgrove succinctly summed up during the charity auction by saying, "It's not Cleveland, is it?"

When it works, though, it is a sight to behold. The Americans looked like a cat toying with a mouse for much of the first half of the final, reeling defenders in only to make the ball disappear with a deft flick or smooth pass to a teammate. Japan's confusion and frustration gave the Americans wide-open spaces in front of the goal, and they easily could have been up 4-0 at halftime.

Asked whether he felt his team was ready for the game, Jones said: "I'd never say that I don't think anybody is ever not ready for a game. Everybody has their own style on how they play, and if they get ready or not. We just have to come out with more fire, especially in day games.

Detectives began re-interviewing witnesses after receiving a Jan. 4 Sun-Times request for all reports on the case.

When you look at the internal data on international tests you find a telling dichotomy regarding American scores. America has a disproportional number of students doing very, very well and a large portion doing poorly. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which administers the PISA test, explains this dichotomy: the number of children in poverty. Twenty-two percent of American children live in mind-numbing poverty, which is far greater than the next highest country. Children do not learn well when they are hungry.

As New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees continues to close in on Dan Marino's single-season passing record, he is carrying his entire team along with him. Brees threw for 412 yards and five touchdowns Sunday in a 42-20 win over Minnesota, leading the Saints to their sixth win in a row. New Orleans had to overcome a sloppy start against Minnesota, including turning the ball over twice deep in its own territory in the first half, botching a surprise onside kick and having a 40-yard TD pass called back because of a penalty. But it mattered little to Brees and the red-hot Saints. Brees now has 4,780 passing yards this season, putting him 304 away from Marino's single-season record of 5,084 yards that he set in 1984. With two games to play, that leaves Brees needing to average just over 150 yards per game. It's hard to imagine Marino's record won't fall.

We also prosecuted the deadliest home arson in Cleveland history under a law that relied partially on the federal Section 8 housing program. Rightfully, the community expected us to use these federal tools to help in those cases.

If you use charcoal, you can arrange the coals in a few different ways. Light your coals as usual.

I’ve been fortunate to cover a few hospital stories over the past year with the Chicago Tribune. While it may sound like an emotionally wrenching assignment, I use the word "fortunate" because I feel that it’s an honor telling the stories of patients going through such hardships.

Linda Wilson: You are right that the left of the two left turn lanes is a continuous flow for traffic to eastbound Manchester. Really the only people that should be stopping in the right left turn lane are those want to cross over to go to West County Mall.

The Four Seasons is a timeless old-style Hawaiian resort — tiki torches, orchid leis and all — which is fine with me. "We absolutely celebrate that fact," Whitfield said.

Since scoring 15 points against Howard in week five, Oakland Mills has scored less points each week since (7, 6, 0). If the Scorpions can score two touchdowns against a Hammond defense that has allowed 73 points in the last two weeks, it would be a small victory at the end of a long season.

Years of experience have taught me that real reconciliation cannot occur without two essential ingredients: trust and truth.

Im not about equality of result when it comes to income inequality. There is income inequality in America. There always has been, and hopefully, and I do say that, there always will be. Why?

So does this mean health-conscious types should pop a Bayer every morning? Possibly, but not necessarily, said Dr. Jack Jacoub, a medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley.
"He's not a very good shot, but that doesn't negate the fact of his intent," Nachtigal said in handing down the verdicts. "He wanted to kill them. He was not successful in his goal, but not for the want of trying. He unloaded the weapon."
Though many Ford workers in Brook Park said they opposed the deal, others said it was the best workers could hope for in a tough economy.
"The gray moved alongside me, crowding me into the rail. I sat chilly, asking for restraint, and Stinger listened, allowing the favorite to go by. I waited. Then waited some more.
The key to cocktails that cool you down on a hot day is in capitalizing on summer's bounty, says Asher, a chef who brings the kitchen into the bar. Whenever possible, use fresh fruit, from watermelon to berries. Also try fresh mint for garnish and the cooling heat of spicy jalapeño for a margarita.

"It looks like too regular a house to give rise to such a character," Cumming said. His favorite Addams Family character? Gomez.
Sandwiches were generally disappointing, and I think the weak bread is to blame. This was true of the grilled cheese and a Thanksgiving sandwich with turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Even the famous cheese toast that Cafe Hon serves its egg salad sandwich on is dry and airy. The best sandwich is the Reuben, which Cafe Hon actually grills instead of throwing under some heat.
Drones come in a variety of sizes, ranging from large aircraft with 116-foot wingspans to tiny craft that can weigh less than an ounce. Under the new FAA rules, civilian drones must weigh less than 55 pounds, stay below an altitude of 400 feet and remain within sight of their operators.

NV Scharffenberger Mendocino County Brut ($19, 12%): This label's marriage with its neighbor, Roederer Estate, continues to pay off. Scharffenberger now might be American sparkling's true outperformer. Even with full malolactic fermentation to soften the texture, this remains fresh and steely. Green apple, poppy seed, grated lemon, morning bun and chalky mineral flavors mesh perfectly.
The ML seats five comfortably; drivers with more passengers than cargo will have to wait until the 2013 model year, when Mercedes will offer it with seven seats. For now, the cargo space is average for this segment, though the rear seats fold completely flat if needed.
Almost forgotten after the sellout crowd calmed down was that the Blues increased their NHL-best point total to 105, staying two ahead of the New York Rangers, who won Tuesday. The Blues put more separation between them and Vancouver, No. 2 in the West with 101 points. They also added distance from Detroit and Nashville, Nos. 2-3 in the Central Division with 97 and 96 points, respectively.

When we've tried to take this series of bumps in the past at higher speeds (above 20 mph) in the regular TRD Tacoma, the results were both jarring and unnerving. It was easy to tell we were running outside the suspension setup's capabilities. However, when trying the same section in the Baja Series, the shocks made all the difference. At 20, 30 and 40 mph, the series of ruts and bumps felt like they were getting smoother. In high-range four-wheel drive, we found the best way to keep control of the Tacoma was to keep the revs high (around 3,000 or 4,000 rpm) in 2nd or 3rd gear (depending on speed) and aim for the tops of the whoops. In fact, after just a short amount of time, it was clear from the feel of the truck that it could do higher speeds as well, which we did.
Feldman: I'm not sure thinking about growth in philanthropy is realistic. So we're thinking a lot more about how to become more self-sufficient and to earn more of our money. Things like the global internet provide opportunities to do that.
Real Madrid could well have lost at Camp Nou and still won La Liga. But actually defeating its eternal rival is something of a game-changer. Mourinho may not admit it, but he didn't just get a monkey off his back, he banished a whole pack of screaming orangutans.

Between 1990 and 2007, when U.S. maritime trade peaked as the recession took hold, there was a fourfold increase in containerized trade through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. In the process, the two San Pedro Bay ports became the nation's busiest maritime gateway. Container traffic through the Port of Oakland, meanwhile, more than doubled.
Defensive coordinator Perry Fewell and his staff. The Giants played exclusively in the nickel Sunday. They switched up the personnel a bit to freshen it up, but they had five DBs on the field for every single play except one, by my count. The loss of middle LB Jonathan Goff has forced Fewell to play mostly nickel this season. But to do it exclusively and to play so well on defense against the Pats for much of the game is a credit to the scheme, the coaches and the players.
Youngblood, who didn't score in the triple jump on Thursday, scored five points for fourth place in the long jump. She got her best jump on her fifth attempt, with a mark of 21-3 1/4.

"I'm drawn to public service," said Bush, who lives in Fort Worth. "Given the opportunity and the stars align, I'd definitely like to consider it. But nothing's on the table right now." Bush said he's "more drawn to state government," with a particular interest in education and "making our taxpayer dollars more accountable to the end user, which is the state taxpayer."
"A woman writer is 'rowing against wind and tide,'" Anne Morrow Lindbergh told her daughter Reeve in 1972, quoting Harriet Beecher Stowe. "We cannot — or only with the greatest difficulty — produce a great 'body of work.'… And it isn't just being a woman. It is some other deeper conflict between art and life." Ultimately, Lindbergh made art from her life; this posthumous collection joins five earlier volumes of diaries and correspondence that explore her experiences with the subtlety and drama of a good novel.

Air samplings along the south edge of the property, which is lined by houses, showed methane concentrations of 30 to 40 percent a couple of years ago, Schwarz said. Methane's explosive range is between 5 and 15 percent concentration; heavier than that and there isn't enough oxygen to sustain a fire, but the higher readings were still troubling. However, the most recent readings were "quite low," below 5 percent, and the methane extraction system is "working quite well," he says.
In better times, they've offered a flying car, a submarine, a custom-fitted medieval suit of armor and even an adult-size mermaid suit.

Most cities renew their contracts with the Orange County Sheriff's Department yearly. When the 2013 contracts come up, county officials will ask for no less than a five-year commitment from its 12 contract cities.

Finally, clothes also figure in the humanity of those who tended to the poorest wretches brought aboard the rescue ship Carpathia. Jones quoted from a letter of a passenger who remembered, "I was very busy ... cutting out garments for the steerage and second-class children, some of whom had no clothes at all. We make little coats and leggings out of the blankets."
Beyond the theoretical solutions, the reality on the snow has been gruesome. At Tahoe's Alpine Meadows during the Christmas-New Year holidays, a snowboarder, 25, was found dead in a tree well in wilderness adjacent to the resort. In Wyoming, also during the holidays, a 22-year-old snowboarder crashed into a mother and her 5-year-old daughter who were stopped on a hill, killing himself and the girl. The latest fatal accident occurred Saturday at Granlibakken, a small North Tahoe resort, where a 22-year-old snowboarder from Oakland, Rahsheka Keith, reportedly tried to use her board as a sled, became turned around and rammed into the support pole of a lift tower.
Even so, the mystery has lost none of its allure, consuming marine architects and amateur sleuths alike for decades. Philip Sims, a former U.S. Navy marine architect, says Ballard and his team's discovery opened up "the whole ocean of undersea wrecks," particularly because of revolutionary deep-sea technology. Sims will be a speaker today at the International Marine Forensics Symposium in National Harbor, Md., where attendees will revisit the sinking of Titanic and other famed ships.

In case you've jumped to the conclusion that Pizzeria Ortica may have been inspired by Pizzeria Mozza, I'd say you're probably right. What chef wouldn't want to emulate the success of the Silverton-Batali juggernaut? But Pizzeria Ortica is not a carbon copy. For one thing, the menu includes pasta, some of the best in Southern California, plus a fine antipasti and salad menu, and a handful of well-conceived main courses.
Environmental groups had pushed for curbs on greenhouse gas emissions, blamed for global warming, and challenged the Bush administration for blocking a waiver request from California to pursue more stringent air pollution rules than required by the federal government. The request was granted by the Obama administration last year.
Saturday afternoon, referee Karl Hess ejected two former N.C. State greats — former NBAer Tom Gugliotta and Chris Corchiani — from the Wolfpack's game against Florida State. Hess refused to answer why he tossed two fans from the game. That's just another example of the officials flexing their muscle, but with no accountability. We're not asking that all officials — the majority of whom do an excellent job under tough circumstances — explain every decision, but there needs to be a system put into place where questions can be asked or things explained. It will make everyone's lives much easier. In the instance on Saturday, what is the harm in explaining why Gugliotta and Corchiani were tossed? Or more commonly, where is the downside in giving the reasoning behind a disputed foul call at the end of a game? There is none. Officials — like coaches and players — should enter the realm of having a forum answer tough questions when the situations call for it.
Raising the direst alarm yet, his administration warned fellow Democrats on Wednesday that if they defeat the tax plan, they could jolt the nation back into recession.

You need to carefully trace each runner back to its source. Then you have two choices: Dig the roots out, or cut the vine off and paint the stump with undiluted Eraser, Weed-Master, Credit 41 or other 41 percent glyphosate herbicide or a 50 percent solution of Roundup.
With weather like this, however, it’s easy to be fooled. Statewide, sunny skies and temperatures in the 60s Wednesday likely had many across New Jersey thinking spring, but for March, it’s pretty much par for the course.

In the near future, science develops a way to make people stop aging at 25. Pretty sweet, except that everyone is also genetically engineered to only live one more year. They can buy more time, allowing the rich go on living at 25 indefinably, while everyone else's clock runs out. Justin Timberlake plays a man accused of murder, who then sets out to shake up the system, with a hostage Amanda Seyfried in tow. Though, pretty sure Timberlake turned 30 this year...
Elmer used a restaurant-quality raspberry jam for the filling, but you can use seedless raspberry jam from the grocery store. Put it in a bowl and whip it up a bit for easy spreading, and spread all the way to the edge of the cake layers.
James Kvaal, the campaign’s policy director, also dismissed Romney’s contention that getting government out of the way by cutting taxes, spending and regulations would spur job creation. “Efforts to cut our way to prosperity have been tried in the past, and Gov. Romney’s vision represents a return to those policies that have failed before,” he said.

“We felt that today’s deal provided us the opportunity to acquire several players that are at or near Major League ready and we could control for five to six years, all of whom have upside potential,” Zduriencik said. “We believe it improves the construction of our Major League roster by adding a right-handed bat and a left-handed arm immediately, and thanks to the young arms we have in our minor league system, we believe that we were able to add talent to our organization while dealing from an area of depth.
While hanging around North Beach and contemplating his future, Bittner, inspired by the eco-friendly writings of Gary Snyder, took to bird-watching. He soon focused his attention on his neighborhood's flock of cherry-headed conures (also known as red-masked parakeets), birds native to South America that either got away from, or were rejected by, their local owners, or escaped during shipment to pet stores. After a long period of patiently building trust, Bittner bonded with the animals, and the results, as captured by filmmaker Judy Irving, are fun to watch. The parrots not only eat out of Bittner's hands, but perch on his shoulders and head as he addresses them by name. Bittner got to know his feathered friends so well that he could recognize individuals, and he happily recounts their stories.
That compared with a surplus of $5.35 billion in March and a deficit of $31.5 billion in February. China often has a large trade deficit early in the year as factories restock after their long lunar new year holiday break.

He was appointed to the Ward B seat on April 6 after Councilwoman Mary Spinello resigned, just weeks before the May 12 election. She had left to head the Jersey City Parking Authority, and the council voted to replace her for the short stretch in what some deemed an inappropriate attempt to give Kenny the "incumbent'' advantage come Election Day.

The Thunder didn't immediately announce whether Harden, who scored 14 points, had a concussion. Bryant and other Lakers acknowledged World Peace is likely to face a multigame suspension with just one game left in their regular season.
But the rule can -- and should -- be your law in your car. Ask back-seat passengers to lock in those seat belts before starting a trip. Far too few of us do that. The LeaseTrader survey indicated only 2 percent of drivers routinely make the safety request over their shoulder. Less than 8 percent ask even half of the time.
“This is an outstanding facility, absolutely outstanding,” Coughlin said. “What I like about it is that the college teams here have been working all fall, so the turf has been broken in well. It’s settled in, and it’s in great shape. It’s going to be great for our players to work out in here all week.”
The late surge before the caucuses for Santorum was the first exhibit, Crawford said. Since then, Republicans elected no self-identified Romney supporters to the Iowa GOP state central committee, Ron Paul backers made a successful play to gain ground within the party structure, the two national committee representatives and state chair refused to sign a delegate loyalty pledge, the party booked a fundraising keynote speaker who has said hes not enthused about Romney, and various outspoken activists have expressed their reluctance about him.
"Ninety-five percent of employees, contrary to popular belief, do their job," said Pagnotta-Murphy, who supervises a small team that maintains city vehicles.
Why do we think Crosby's peeps are behind this? The item reads: "'She is heartbroken, but she is already writing great songs about it,' the pal says. The singer will keep herself busy with an upcoming tour to promote her album Flawz, the friend notes." Way to stay on message.
At a sidewalk picnic table, I talked beer with 5Q regulars Zach Christensen and Heidi Leibbrandt, who make their own brew and grow hops at their nearby home. Christensen, who's "in telecom," nursed a pint of Lompoc's C-Note pale ale, brewed with seven hops that start with "C" (Crystal, Cluster, Cascade, Chinook, Centennial, Columbus and Challenger). It rates a chart-topping 100 International Bitterness Units, a measure of hop infusion, which Portland beer geeks bandy about the way wine fans talk about grippy tannins.
The airport is also seeking to attract more carriers. On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors authorized a $250,000 cash offer to Virgin America to lure it to Sacramento. That money would come from an existing program funded by airport restaurants and shops.

"Ramble At The Ryman"
What advice would you give incoming freshmen? That they should get involved. Getting involved with the things that interest a student will teach him far more than a classroom ever could. I would also tell students to follow their hearts and their passions and that everything else will fall into place. Finally, take every opportunity that is afforded, as one does not know where these opportunities will lead.
And at some point in 2012, he will take them to Baltimore.
Kimbrough traveled to more than 40 countries.

The Institute for Supply Management's better-than-expected report, improving manufacturing data overseas and a surprise jump in U.S. construction spending in June, helped push stock markets higher.

"It's going to take years," Jim Farley, Ford's global marketing chief said at an event at the IAC Building in New York City Monday night.

The newspaper found the agency — which treats the sewage of more than 1.3 million people in Essex, Bergen, Passaic and Hudson counties — was being used by its commissioners as a private piggy bank, hiring wives, brothers, in-laws and children; approving special-interest contracts; and hiring of politically connected officials at six-figure salaries.
Kim was not eligible for the Masters. He is not exempt for the U.S. Open. Tuesday was the first time he hit balls since he withdrew from the Texas Open. After one swing, he clutched his right elbow. There was a duck-hook with the driver, another shot that resembled a shank. The other shots were mostly good, though Kim said he still feels a jolt in his elbow even after hitting wedges.
The many theorists out there who believe Cuomo wants President Obama to lose in November in order to abet his own presidential aspirations will find support on Page 25 of the speech, where, when noting the new federal health-care law should cut some insurance costs in New York, the governor failed to give Obama any credit for his signature plan.
A former pilot for Delta Air Lines, Montague spent 15 years flying Asian routes out of Portland until they were canceled. He also flew occasionally to Honolulu from Atlanta but has been to Maui only once.

If we don't start using our own resources and stop trying to be the hero of global warming, we forever will be dependent on other countries for our energy needs. It's time for congressional leaders to stop the EPA from destroying our country from within.
That's a tiny number in relative terms, and the Snake River fish still have to make it to their home lakes in central Idaho. But it's the highest sockeye return recorded at Lower Granite since it was built in 1975, and nearly 25 times the average return of the last 10 years. Ten years ago two sockeye came back.
In an email Tuesday, the Maryland Democratic Party accused Romney of wanting to "go back to the same economic policies that got us into this mess in the first place." Southern Maryland Rep. Steny H.

Toyota's resurgence could mean better deals as rivals fight for customers by offering discounts and promotions. Already, Toyota has announced zero-percent financing and other deals in May.

In addition to accommodations, the deal includes a complimentary wine-tasting card for 30 wineries in Sonoma Valley.
It's gorgeous to look at, but a little incongruous, given the rest of the artist's career. So it makes sense to follow the example of Val Espinoza, a fellow tourist I met on the steps beneath Rivera's allegory. Espinoza and his wife, Rosa, had come from Fresno just to look at Rivera murals, and this was one of three stops for them. (I'll have to check out these two others on my next trip.)

But the pavilion visitors see today was built in the 1950s to replace the original, which was burned down by a crazed monk.

So this is the perfect time for a new bridge, and LeBron is the choice to lay the foundation. He's the league's most gifted player. His resolve has increased. He's 28, the age when youthful energy blends with know-how -- the same age as MJ and Shaq when they won their first.

"This is so surreal I can't even believe this," he said.
Thursday night's scene featured a bit of everything. There were white people, black people, elderly couples, children in strollers and dogs on leashes. T-shirt sellers were getting $10 for shirts with Zimmerman's picture below a huge "WANTED" sign. Other T-shirts read, "I am Trayvon Martin," underscoring the theme of many speakers' comments that anybody could fall victim to a bullet if confronted by someone carrying a loaded gun and claiming self-defense.

The ash cloud, drifting between 20,000 to 30,000 feet (6,000 to 9,000 meters) high and invisible from the ground, initially blocked the main air flight path between the U.S. east coast and Europe. On Friday, the cloud's trajectory was taking it over northern France and Austria and into eastern and central Russia at about 25 mph (40 kph).
"Also, I don't believe it should start at pre-1967, at those boundaries. I disagreed with the president on that, as did Harry Reid in in a speech that night and others. But I think that they are moving towards an agreement on which way to go."

Judy Tisdale suggests serving the salad in bowls, not on salad plates. "Both my grandmother and mother regularly made this salad, as do I. My adult children request it when they come home," she wrote.
Manufacturers of Class 1 devices — gadgets with few or no moving parts, such as tongue depressors, usually have to simply register with the FDA. When the agency allows such devices to go to market, "they aren't passing judgment that one tongue depressor is any better than any other tongue depressor," Maisel says. "They're just saying it's a safe device."
Of his own performance as "The Wild One"-channeling teen rebel Mutt (who turns out to be Indy's son), LaBeouf says this: "You get to monkey-swinging and things like that and you can blame it on the writer and you can blame it on Steven. But the actor's job is to make it come alive and make it work, and I couldn't do it. So that's my fault. Simple."
"I'm sure I could go out and say, `Please, don't do anything negative,'" Romney told Fox News. "But this is politics. And if you can't stand the heat in this little kitchen, wait until Obama's Hell's Kitchen turns up the heat."

What would Jesus do about today's arguments over sexual identity? I don't know. He didn't say. Matthew 7:12 is the best I've found: "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."
Since then we have made other furniture for him -- always with a perch feature that he can curl his talons around comfortably. It's very awkward for him to walk flat-footed. He spends most of the time on a perch on top of the dresser, munching and making quiet, conversational noises. He usually comes twice a day -- an hour or so after sunrise (which makes us avid supporters of daylight-saving time) -- and an hour or so before sunset.
In addition to Cottrell, Foster and her infant daughter, the duplex also was home to Foster's 20-year-old boyfriend, and his 11 siblings, mother and stepfather, according to investigators.

"Fortunately, while I write about the struggle, I wake up in the morning most of the time with a smile on my face, and I've managed to make it to the other side of these things. But I know if I just stay true to the experience, and to what I see as real, it's not gonna leave 'em in a dark place -- it just exposes a dark place. I guess what I'm saying is that it's OK to talk about it. I also think if I explain how hard is has been for me, people don't feel so alone. I know that's my reaction when I listen to sad, hard songs -- 'Oh God, they went through that, too. I'm not so alone.'"

Smith called much of past and current leadership "an elite clique whose sole agenda consisted of nothing more than personal gain and self enrichment." Some of his conclusions, Smith said, were based on personal observations as operations commander of Camp Roberts a few years ago.
Most voters may be unaware of the initiative. It was ordered placed on the ballot earlier this month.

Medical Center in Albuquerque, NM.
The use of drone aircraft perpetuates the illusion that military force is an effective means of countering terrorism and resolving political differences. We should know better by now. After 10 years of combat in Afghanistan the threat of terrorist attack and insurgent violence remains as great as ever. May 2011 was the deadliest month for Afghan civilians since the U.N. began keeping records in 2007, the agency's Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported. June's death toll was almost as high.
Politicians should treat economic development deals as if they are spending their own money, carefully checking out each proposal, understanding that even the most deeply examined ones inherently are a gamble.

"The Maryland State Board of Education has already looked at this issue from this particular document and said it's not an education issue," Dyer said to Aquino.

The fact that Paul and Rachel Chandler couldn't pay a big ransom helped stretch out their ordeal to 388 agonizing days - until Sunday, when they were released, thin and exhausted but smiling.

Another find is the Chopra Center, which moved from La Jolla to the La Costa Resort. Deepak Chopra, the most popular evangelist of traditional Indian medicine, has his U.S. headquarters in a resort surrounded by tennis pros and polo-shirted golfers. For a while, Chopra was offering a way to integrate Indian mental centering techniques with golf – though I didn't see it on the spa menu. The materials did mention that those with a "pitta dosha" personality (one of the Ayurvedic body types) can be especially angry when they hit a bad shot. There is a full menu of yoga and meditation. It's a world within the La Costa world – and one that fits the word "east."
School construction manager Dave Tillou said there is good news. Some of the board’s professionals, such as its architect and engineers, are reducing their charges because, in part, “the job is getting done faster than anticipated.” The kitchen construction is finished and students were expected to be served hot meals on Tuesday for the first time this school year, said school superintendent Dr. Chrys Harttraft.

He was the spirit of the E Street Band, and the oaken staff that Bruce Springsteen leaned on.
Yet what is best for the rest of us isn’t necessarily what is best for Rondo. He’s 26. He still has some youthful defiance in him. He still has some youthful arrogance. He’s not Ray Allen. He’s not the personification of coolness and mature professionalism. Rondo can be brash. His teammates call him "Swag" for a reason. He does things like throw a ball at a referee in anger in February. He is young and stubborn. And that’s why he would stand there and not only resist saying he was sorry, but insist he had nothing to prove in this game.

A thought for all of us sentenced to a 24/7 news cycle wherein every comment, statement or aside is endlessly vetted: Give 'em a break. Presidential campaigns are political pressure cookers. Politicians are human beings. They can get tired, cranky and careless. They remind us that nobody is perfect. As much as we might like to revel in the difficulties of our political opponents, obvious misstatements should not become prime campaign fodder. Our unsettled economy and numerous military engagements around the world provide us plenty of real issues to debate. Given the high stakes involved, we can do better than this.

Wisconsin's Supreme Court race this spring is likely to intensify the already heated national debate over judicial selection in the states. From the hyperbolic rhetoric in media reports, one would think that the very legitimacy of state courts is at stake when ignorant voters are allowed to decide whether judges should retain their jobs. The New York Times editorial board lamented last month: "Whoever ultimately gets the job, all of Wisconsin has lost. This nasty, highly politicized race is raising serious questions about the impartiality of the state's highest court."

That's not to say that an Exelon-Constellation merger is a great thing. It still takes a corporate headquarters out of Baltimore, and as EDF officials have pointed out, it greatly diminishes the chances for the construction of a new nuclear reactor at Calvert Cliffs and will almost certainly result in the loss of high-paying jobs here. But the criteria on which the Public Service Commission can judge this deal are narrow: Does it provide benefits for BGE customers, does it produce no harm for them, and is it in the public interest? With the terms Mr. O'Malley secured, the commission should be able to answer all three in the affirmative.

There aren't that many tournaments, but there's two massive events on grass this year (in addition to its traditional tourney, Wimbledon will be the site of the Olympics tennis competition). I have done well on clay, but I do think I can play on grass as well."
"The Camry Effect": With over 7 million Toyota Camry drivers out there, the company wants the world to know that, yes, even YOU should drive one. George Clooney's narration only drives home the suggestion more.

"The elephant in the room here is opening up the West Coast to exporting coal to China," said Brett VandenHeuvel, Columbia Riverkeeper's executive director. "The fact that it's being ignored is hugely problematic. For us to simultaneously oppose coal plants here and happily export that coal to China is inconsistent."
Tom was born in Cassville, Mo., to John and Mable Mae (Peacock) Herd. The family moved to Gresham, where he graduated from Gresham High School in 1953.
I don't even talk to my neighbors because my neighbors don't talk to me. I have never been so, I guess, dishonored. My mother who is like 78, out in the yard picking stuff and people don't talk to her. I would never walk by a person who was older than me and not pay them the respect. It's almost like we are an inconvenience, like "You were here. Yes, we know you were here. But now we're here."
Gresham officials are advising against entry into the Columbia Slough downstream from Portal Way due to evidence of contamination.

A: The biggest thing people can do is just do as much research as they can on what is in their community. There are so many resources out there, but they're hard to navigate. And there have been a lot of cutbacks. It's pretty bleak. And at the very least, we need insurance legislation to go through and we have to figure out how do we help our children access treatment.
Private economists widely support the Fed's shift toward more transparency. Most dismiss concerns that the Fed, by being more open and specific in forecasting rates, might lock itself into wrongheaded policies.

Woodruff was fired Wednesday night, said Phyllis Kinsler, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Central Jersey.

MIT and Harvard officials emphasized that they would use the new online platform not just to build a global community of online learners but also to research teaching methods and technologies. Online courses with thousands of students give researchers the ability to monitor students' progress, they said, identifying what they click on and where they have trouble. Already, a researcher from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, using the MIT Circuits course, found that students overwhelmingly preferred to read the handwritten notes of Agarwal rather than the same notes presented on PowerPoint.

A school apparently at the other end of the spectrum is the music magnet at Hillside Elementary in Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw, where proficiency rates are 37% in English and 50% in math. Hillside magnet students are below the statewide average but well above average when compared with similar high-poverty, minority populations. And their proficiency rates are more than twice as high as those of the host school.

A quick online search demonstrated some of the near-legendary memories attached to those tournaments. On its alumni website, McBride High School gives major kudos to its team that won the 1939 Normandy tournament (and later the state championship).

I don't think so.
So it is encouraging that Gov. Jerry Brown is, like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger before him, appointing jurists that are more reflective of California's composition. Brown, in fact, deserves credit for having placed a new emphasis on diversity in bench appointments during his two terms as governor in the 1970s. But that was three decades ago. Why is there still such a lag?
Seattle-area tactical officers who slogged for hours over dangerously steep, muddy ground to find him were prepared, too. They pumped in tear gas, called for him over bullhorns, and, after 22 hours, on Saturday set off explosives along the top of the bunker.
"The potential is there," Horne said. "We've got some talent. We're definitely young. We've got some juniors. We've also got two freshmen who are going to play a lot for us, and a sophomore."
øSaldana, who left the Army in 2004, hasn't worked full time in 18 months. He's scoured "'help wanted" listings, taken college courses and earned an emergency medical technician certificate. But he finds himself pigeonholed. "What do you come out with having been an artillery man or in the infantry?" he asks. "The best job you can get is security. That's not what I want to do for the rest of my life."
5. Mix and match. It's not just OK to mix old with new; it's a new decor must. Caprara's living room combines modern-print sofas from West Elm with her refurbished thrift-store finds. The combination is warm, contemporary and one-of-a-kind.
No it wasn’t. It was a crazy, paranoid question. Four years ago, when a woman at one of his rallies began to rant about Barack Obama being an anti-American Muslim, presidential candidate John McCain took the microphone away and said she was wrong. Obama was a good American and a good family man with whom he simply disagreed, McCain said.

In Iran, rice pudding can be eaten as a meal on hot days, or as a token of respect at religious gatherings. Maykadeh, a Persian restaurant in North Beach, makes shola-e-zard, a saffron rice pudding, for special events. The cooks boil rice with sugar and water and add saffron, which turns the rice yellow, then add rose water and sugar to taste.
Another one of his employees also testified. Jim Duke, treasurer and controller at Executive Caterers, said he was made aware that the company issued two bills where 400-plus people attended political events for Dimora in 2006 -- but he did not know about it until after the corruption probe began.

FitzGerald sometimes would preface remarks with, "Let me tell you what I won't do. . . . Such responses leave to the imagination how he might fund economic development projects or address cries for change in the county's Department of Children and Family Services.

Roberto Hernandez was placed on baseball's restricted list after he was arrested in the Dominican Republic on false identity charges last month. Authorities have said Hernandez is 31, three years older than he claimed.
What Gould is saying is that in a world this over-saturated, where we are overwhelmed by either obligation or distraction, the most essential act is the emptiest, the one that forces us to face that there is nothing behind humanity's facade. "Not one of the works of art in the gallery," he says of an attack on the Tate Modern, "remotely matched the limitless potency of a terrorist bomb." And later: "To keep the world sane we depend on motive, we rely on cause and effect. Kick those props away and we see that the meaningless act is the only one that has any meaning."
ø"I don't know. We have to figure that out. Some way, somehow," Anthony said. Everybody's got to do it.
The two men wound up buying the Watts Towers, which led to the formation of a citizens committee in 1959 to preserve and exhibit the walled complex of spires — the tallest is nearly 100 feet — and other structures decorated with broken pottery, seashells, glazed tiles and pieces of colored glass.

The orbiter had originally been set to soar over New York and New Jersey on Monday. The flyover was postponed due to rain and wind.
Why has it taken so long for this film to get made? I call it a poisoned chalice. People have been trying to make movies about Bob Marley for years, both fictions films and documentaries. At least a dozen fiction films have come and gone, and some of them are still trying to get made. It's a very complex, litigious world, the world of Marley. A lot of different people own various rights, and you need to get everybody on your side. But in the end I was able to use the footage and songs I wanted on a reasonable budget.
Every time things get horrifying, though, we cut back to the tech wizards who are orchestrating the whole experience. The “scares” are therefore “ironic” and, being safely cordoned off behind these “quotation marks,” aren’t scary. While some of the one-liners are funny, the only reason I could think of to keep watching is to learn what the overarching reason behind the setup might be. When this answer is delivered, though, it’s weak, and it is given in the clunkiest possible way: A new character simply walks onscreen and explains the back story. Worse: It’s a celebrity cameo. Worse still: The “reveal” nullifies everything the protagonists have been trying to do.

"I hope to remind children and teachers alike that learning should be fun and can have positive effects far beyond the classroom, because we're trying to equip students with the ability to critically evaluate their own situation," Clark said. "It's not about getting them to remember all the facts, but showing them how to make the best decision by understanding their personal situation and gathering as much information as they can."
“We’re not Jeremy Lin,” said Olasewere, “but to have a city like that on our back, and to represent ’em in a tournament like this, it’s a blessing.”
Under the rules of racing, a horse that loses its rider during a race is either listed as a non-starter or a non-finisher or is automatically listed as coming in last. To the establishment, the idea of a horse crossing the wire alone is just about as preposterous as a jockey trotting to the finish without a mount.
Health insurance companies also must cover oral cancer drugs, treating them on a "no less favorable basis that intravenous anticancer medications," according to another bill Christie also signed.
"I didn't think I was going to have anybody because I had the fastest time by 30 seconds," Fischer said. "Then Courtney Rogers came up and led six laps. I was trying to stay calm because I knew she was going to try to take off. When we had 800 meters left, I was like, ‘OK, I have to go now.' I probably should have kicked harder too then. I just haven't been lately, I don't know why."

Salinger's other books don't equal the influence or sales of "Catcher," but they are still read, again and again, with great affection and intensity. Critics, at least briefly, rated Salinger as a more accomplished and daring short story writer than John Cheever.
His team felt differently – that was clear by how they reacted to the victory. They rushed closer Reynaldo Hernandez after he punctuated the victory by striking out Castano. Minutes later, they dumped the Gatorade bucket on Mandl and whatever was left on Corniel. It had nothing to do with the opponent, Rodriguez said. It was about winning a title.

So I thought I'd put together a list of my favorite baseball movies of all time. The two most important factors in compiling the list were that they had to be about baseball, and I had to be willing to watch them more than once.
“Do it. You’ve got to do it,” he said. “You’ve got to go through situations where you don’t have success to learn what you did wrong, the defining moments within a series where you have to find a way to get through it and be successful. That hasn’t happened here. I think we’ve added pieces over the last couple years that have been through that a little bit and that’s going to help this time around.

This week, I digress from my normal weekly rant about my household foibles and fiascos to bring you some actual breaking news: I met Martha Stewart.
Elias, by all accounts, had been playing well but was missing that tally. For a playmaker and goal-scorer, it built up some tension. It was visible to his teammates, who tried allaying him. But when your role is defined by numbers, their words weren’t as potent as goals.
Coming off a wave election of their own in 2010, Republicans need to add only four Senate seats (three, if they win the White House) to regain the majority. First-termers like Brown are prime targets, especially if they're also from states like Ohio, where President Barack Obama's approval ratings are underwater. Brown's unapologetic liberalism and often zealous partisanship make him an especially inviting target. In 34-year-old Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the GOP has a challenger with a strong personal story, little public record to attack, a proven ability to raise money and a willingness -- shown in 2010 -- to do whatever it takes to win.

Durga Nath takes out a battered suitcase filled with snake charmer memorabilia. He once traveled to Japan (a real "snakes on a plane") for a charmer publicity stunt, appeared in the 2010 Commonwealth Games' opening ceremony, and was summoned by authorities in 1999 when Hindu right-wingers threatened to release several slithery specimens during an India-Pakistan cricket match.

The parents, who met earlier Monday with Bloomington police, would particularly like to hear from Corey Rossman, one of the students who was with Lauren Spierer that night.
The critics have also wondered aloud - from radio and television sports shows to newspaper columns and even Monday-morning-quarterback perches - whether Tim Tebow has the right stuff to be an NFL quarterback. And though not always a Tebow believer, I've been born again by a young QB who continues somehow to find a way to win.
Ohio is on the right track with these bills. Pension forfeiture should be the rule, not the exception, when someone who is supposed to be serving the public betrays the public instead. The public should not have to finance the retirement of an employee or officeholder guilty of malfeasance.
Authorities say a man charged with the attempted murder of his girlfriend was a parole violator who had been released early from county jail because of overcrowding.

I'd hazard to say that most of the dudes behind the "Brokeback" mashups haven't seen the film. No matter; having parodied it, they'll want to check it out. And I have a dream, see. I dream that somewhere out in Bushland people who missed "Brokeback Mountain" in theaters, either through their own fear or their neighborhood Cineplex's refusal to show it, will feel safe ordering it from Netflix and watching it in the privacy of their shag-carpeted living rooms, sandwiched between "American Pie II" and that sanctimonious exercise in sadomasochism, "The Passion of the Christ." Maybe they'll even toss in "Evil Dead," just for chuckles.

But live TV has taken on a mystique for both performers and viewers ever since video tape was invented during TV's infancy in the 1950s.

Much of the discussion surrounding the anniversary of bin Laden's death, however, has focused not on national security but on politics. President Barack Obama has made his decision to launch the mission that killed bin Laden a part of his re-election campaign, and Republicans have roundly criticized him for exploiting that success for partisan advantage. Of course, there's more than a bit of hypocrisy in the GOP complaint, since President George W. Bush used the capture of Saddam Hussein for similar purposes when he ran for re-election.

Oregon roughed up UCLA (20-6, 7-3) starter Adam Plutko early scoring five runs in the game's first four innings.

Ryan and other politicians tend not to subtract the $1 trillion when mentioning the infrastructure deficit, a point of clarification.

Now 66, Farley moved to Portland in 1980. In addition to a regular job, he had a side gig as DJ for weddings, parties and corporate events.

But Farley, divorced and with two kids ages 3 and 5, wasn't one to turn down any job.

In August, President Obama and European allies publicly called on Assad to step down. But despite his government's bloody response to its own people, Western military intervention, which theoretically could speed Assad's departure, seems to be off the table. Any such undertaking would encounter objections from Russia and China, veto-wielding nuclear powers on the United Nations Security Council; the challenge ofSyria's difficult terrain and extensive antiaircraft batteries; and uncertainty about a largely unknown opposition that may include a substantial contingent of Islamist militants.

Since he came to power in 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had little regard for the Obama administration's opinions — because the president has not been afraid to speak his mind about Israel's intransigence and a policy which might be dubbed "shoot first, ask questions later."

In his speech, Cameron decried multiculturalism's "hands-off tolerance" of some cultural behaviors -- he used the example of forced marriages -- that are antithetical to Western values. Instead, Britain needs to win the hearts and minds of newcomers with the ideals of personal liberty and individualism, combating multiculturalism-induced rootlessness that can cause some to find a home in political extremism.
"My original way into theater was through reading," he says, recalling a boyhood illuminated by Joseph Heller's "Catch-22" and all of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s books. "When I fell in love with theater it was because that was a way of making the stories I loved come alive."
It's hard to argue for dramatic changes in good times, and it's always tough for an outsider -- even one with Icahn's pedigree and billions -- to win a proxy fight.
The Sacketts had bought the lot near Priest Lake in Idaho planning to build a home, but after they had cleared the land, they were told by EPA officials that it was a regulated wetland.
Other new bars, like the Sloppy Tuna, a beachfront nightclub, and the Crow's Nest Inn, started by hotelier and restaurateur Sean MacPherson, have created less of a stir among locals since they are located downtown.

If any misdeeds are limited to Dunn, then the impact will fall on Dunn rather than on Best Buy, Spieckerman said. But if the investigation determines he frequently used company funds in the pursuit of an inappropriate relationship, then "heads will have to roll," she added.
"Extending the Bush tax cuts will get about 30 cents of stimulus for each federal dollar invested, while costing the country $700 billion over the next ten years," Kaptur said. "We will have to borrow from China and Saudi Arabia to pay for these tax cuts, while Wall Street pulls record profits and the nation continues to suffer through what feels like to many a jobless recovery."

I was glad to not have to wait long for a table, but the back seemed overly spare and isolated. I missed the comfy touches of the front room -- the picture windows, the honeyed lighting and the open kitchen, with marble counters the colors of a calico cat.
Q: Hey, Tony: Has there been any reports, good or bad, about that huge undrafted offensive lineman we picked up from Canada, Joel Reinders? He has freakish physical attributes. I'd like to see us keep him and develop him more. Could be a nice find. Joel Reinders vs. Cliff Geathers in one-on-one drills must be interesting . . . who do you think would win? -- Robert Benjamin Jr., Crestview, Fla
One of Philadelphia's great assets is a huge inventory of affordable housing, a key to our population growth. And plenty of eager investors are ready and willing to buy properties and vacant lots.

Before this game, pitching coach Dave Eiland asked Luis Mendoza what had changed since spring training. Luis pitched as well or better than anyone in Surprise, but has pitched poorly since breaking camp. Luis said he thought he had to be better to compete during a big league season. The result has been being too fine  trying to make perfect pitches on the corners. Dave Eiland told Luis to trust his stuff, pound the zone with low strikes and let hitters get themselves out.

The Kings already were leading 1-0 by the time that fight took place, having taken the air out of the Blues and the building with Richards scoring only 31 seconds into the game, converting a rebound after Penner’s solid drive to the net.
A: Cash for Clunkers, the summertime government program that gave consumers up to $4,500 to trade in a clunker for a more fuel-efficient vehicle, helped many new car dealers reduce their inventories in July and August. And most car companies have cut production because of the tough economy so many consumers had less to choose from when they surveyed dealerships in October.

LaGace said the district has made switching to a new platform an easy step for students and teachers, including providing a way for iPad users to access the district's "cloud" to open files that are created on netbooks or teacher tablets. Each iPad will be equipped with a rubberized cover that should protect it from most drops and dings. Schools will get to choose whether the equipment stays on campus or goes home with students, he said.
So I was surprised to see the 2010 Barkan Classic Pinot Noir selling for $10.99 at the Wine and Cheese Place, 457 North New Ballas Road in Creve Coeur. The timing couldn't have been better, because pinot noir is a good wine to bring to a Passover seder, which like Thanksgiving feasts, incorporates a range of foods and flavors. Pinot noir is a versatile red that goes well with popular seder entrees such as brisket, roast chicken or salmon.
Corruption is embedded in China's unique approach to economic and political governance. When China began to experiment with capitalism in the late 20th century, many government officials became entrepreneurs. The Communist Party also encouraged local officials to compete for investment. These local officials gained enormous power, which they used to demand bribes, distribute resources and provide favors.

Mammograms and colorectal screening tests are meant to screen a healthy population for conditions in which it's proved that treatments give significant benefit, i.e. longer life or better quality of life.

Because of the program's structure, many long-term owners enjoy steep discounts on their tax bills, while recent buyers pay the full cost, the recent Sun investigation documented. One result is that wealthier residents who have owned their homes for years pay just a fraction of their annual tax bill.
Three Ohio men -- Douglas Shisler of Doylestown, Peter J. Esposito of Middleburg Heights and James L. Binge of Jackson Township in Stark County -- were charged for their roles as Cyprus Funds co-directors. Shisler and Esposito each served less than three years in federal prison and are now free. Binge died while his case was pending.
Twelve years ago, the Shackletts expanded production to a greenhouse near their home in the even more remote, isolated hamlet of Onyx, a 40-minute drive west of Ridgecrest. They closed the facility three years ago, after the price of propane skyrocketed and it became too expensive to heat it.
First, here's what it won't do: take sides, award you money if you've been harmed or return funds you've spent. And it doesn't launch inquiries into complaints it doesn't have the legal authority to look into -- those against nurses, for example.
There were teeny tostada rounds mounded high with diced raw hamachi ringing with lime aioli, pico de Gallo and chile piquin. The meatballs glazed in ancho-cranberry barbecue sauce hid the surprise of melty Oaxaca cheese inside. Tender skewered octopus were most notable for the presentation — the octo-kebab sliced into oblong coins for maximum tentacle crisp-age. The carnitas tacos were tender from their beer, Coke and orange juice braise. Chicken enchiladas came beneath an ebony shine of my new favorite mole poblano, its mysteriously blend of 25 ingredients (from mulatto chiles to hazelnuts, figs, pepitas and tomatillos) in sharper balance than Cantina’s sweeter suburban rendition.
“Why do people who wear perfume insist on using so much? For all the world to smell?

Please consider your fellow man.”
Its an unfortunate situation, Bryant said. James, from what I hear, is OK. As far as Metta goes, he has to focus on himself, and however many games they give him, they give him. He just has to be prepared, and when he comes back, just step right in and be ready to go.

The original version ran about 4 1/2 hours; at 2 1/2 hours, the international version shown here seems a bit much. But it has commitment and style, and you can see why Woo, the noted Hong Kong action director, would want to produce it: It fits right in with his "heroic bloodshed" cinematic legacy.

Instead of getting what they're worth, the players receive athletic scholarships that don't cover the full cost of attending school, leaving many of them living below the poverty line, says the report, "The Price of Poverty in Big Time College Sport."
A year and a half later, we were ready to take a few more tentative steps (literally and figuratively) out of the studio. We wanted to dance. Out-on-the-town dance. We wanted to go to dinner at a nice restaurant and, with casual elegance, slip from our seats and glide to the dance floor. But where was there such a place?
The surface drudgery of a bad date isn't the only hazard of thoughtless matchmaking, though: It also holds insult potential when you get paired with your definition of a grasping lowlife or galloping head case.
One reporter at today's news conference wondered if Kucinich regretted not going after Kaptur more forcefully on her home turf.
"It's fine as long as it helps us to win nationals," Schmitt said. "To get to nationals is an absolute dream. They've worked so hard. They've been out doing two-a-days right now in the St. Louis summer."
The witty Youngs remains best known for the quiet, confessional "F*** was I," the lament of a woman who couldn’t stop herself from falling in love with a close friend. She may break out her acoustic guitar when she takes the stage Thursday at Maxwell’s with her three-piece band. Yet considering the propulsive sound of her "An Unwavering Band of Light" album, due out Feb. 7, attendees should expect her to rock.
"During the time we were closed, there were other businesses opened under the Burns name," Cory said. "In order to eliminate confusion, we decided to add 'Original' to our name to inform customers that we are, and always will be, the Original Burns BBQ that they know and love. We still use the same pits and the same recipes that my grandfather used."
About two thirds of Nashville’s middle-school math teachers volunteered to participate in the experiment. Half of the 296 teachers were placed randomly in a control group, while the rest were eligible for bonuses of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 if their pupils scored significantly higher than expected on a statewide exam.
Bales' post from March 2011, about the Army promotion, appears to have been the blog's latest entry. In it, she explained why she maintained the site in the first place. The collection of posts was a "time capsule," she wrote, and she hoped that her children would one day "enjoy reading about the decisions that Mom and Dad went through during their lives."
"It's stupid to keep these," he said. "But how many people have ashes from the 1906 earthquake?"
According to the grand jury report, Paterno testified that he referred the account relayed by the assistant to his superior. Paterno has maintained that a more detailed description of what allegedly occurred in the showers was never passed on to him.

As chief judge of the Court of Appeals, Lippman presides over New York's Office of Court Administration -- with its 18,000-plus employees, $2.7 billion budget and life-and-death grip on issues of intense interest to trial lawyers everywhere.
Danny Coughlan sets the tone here with a doo-wop-flavored waltz called "I Cherish the Heartbreak More Than the Love That I Lost," which somehow manages to live up to its title, and proceeds to mope his way like the kid in a Morrissey haircut through an album packed with devastated love songs. The '60s-flavored pop gem "We're Supposed to Be in Love" finds him pining the title with total conviction, followed by "But in the very same breath we're finding different ways of breaking apart." The overall effect feels like Morrissey singing an album of singles Phil Spector was hoping to pitch to Roy Orbison, hopelessly devoted to the sound and passion of a bygone era.
So where is the doubt about Clemons' guilt?
It was not until July 2011 that Maryland's highest court, the Court of Appeals, spoke on the question of the impact of Maryland's speech or debate clause. Unfortunately, it repeated the sins of the Court of Special Appeals in the Blondes case by not taking the opportunity to give full weight to the anti-bribery provision that had been added to the Maryland Constitution in 1867.
The parents of Fee's partners, the boards of the two theaters, were intrigued but wary.
"The prospect of drilling in Ohiopyle is going to be tremendously jarring," said John Quigley, the former secretary of Pennsylvania's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and now a consultant for the environmental group Penn Future.

While Kasich blamed previous governors for over-promising funds for ODOT projects, it is worth noting that Wray previously served as ODOT's director from 1991 to 1999 under governors George Voinovich and Bob Taft. Also former Gov. Ted Strickland, when he took office in 2007, raised concerns over whether ODOT had enough money to cover planned projects.

Indeed, the "uninsured crisis" itself is properly regarded as a symptom, not a cause, of high costs. The insured consume two and a half times as much health care as the uninsured. This massive consumption is largely a result of being insured, and therefore immunized from the direct cost of health care. It's as if you paid a $10 co-pay for a tank of gas and your car insurer paid the balance. The roads would be even more congested than they are now! Further, one third to one half of this spending does not contribute to better health. The blunt fact is that most of us are overinsuredbut few of us are prepared to accept that fact, so most politicians ignore it.
Matthew Bennett, who represents Schurick, said political speech is often deceiving and that the prosecution of Schurick creates a "slippery slope" that could curtail free speech. He said he saw a campaign poster during that election that depicted O'Malley as being on a ticket with Obama — which he said was designed to trick voters into casting ballots for the incumbent governor. He said the poster was misleading because Obama wasn't running.
This week, the Liberty Towers apartment complex in Newton contacted an exterminator to battle an infestation. Last week, the AMC/Loews movie complex at Monmouth Mall closed after bedbugs were found.

In a report to the Metro Council, Auditor Suzanne Flynn said the regional government has plans in place to buy, stabilize and develop nature parks, but not for ongoing maintenance. Because of that, employees "filled the void with their own initiative and experience" and sometimes worked at cross purposes.
The roasted-malt character of this almost-black schwarzbier displays itself with a cocoa-powder aroma. The flavor, however, is not nearly as roasty as the color suggests. The beer's lager yeast, pilsner malt and German hops combine to create a clean-tasting beer with a crisp, dry finish. If you've been fooled by the misconception that dark equals heavy, this beer will set you straight. Available on draft at the brewery and several bars and restaurants around town. At 4.4 percent ABV, you could drink several Black Lagers on St. Patrick's Day.

Thoms said he was puzzled by comments made by PBA President Ives pertaining to different police cultures in the two communities.
That would be a mistake -- at least this early in the careers of both rookies. Jamison's presence is benefiting the club, and specifically the two first-rounders. Despite a few dubious shooting nights -- notably 6-of-20 in the opener against Toronto -- he is the only other starter besides Irving creating his own shot. That can't be overstated. Take away Jamison, and Irving loses one of his best options as well as a player who can stretch the defense and create lanes for the penetrating point guard.
Children are repeatedly encased in pressurized oxygen chambers normally used after scuba diving accidents. This unproven therapy is meant to reduce inflammation that experts say is little understood and may even be beneficial.

physical characteristics. Still, we don't see the phrase "Irish-looking man" in the newspaper, though red hair and pale skin are common Irish characteristics. Would a picture come to mind if a TV anchor said, "The suspect appeared to be Italian"?

The number of kids in state custody increased from 10,515 in September 2010 to 11,682 on Oct. 31, 2011, the last day of the Department of Economic Security's most recent, and still unreleased, report on kids in care. That's an 11 percent increase. Yet DES Director Clarence Carter says he did not ask for additional funding for children in out-of-home care.
Get over the stigma. The perception that it's only the downtrodden shopping at thrift and consignment stores has all but been quashed thanks to a stubbornly stagnant economy. And shows like A&E's "Storage Wars" and the History Channel's "American Pickers" have turned that stigma into mystique, Cutler said. Bottom line: if you're going to shop thrift, swallow your pride and grab a cart.
Sarah: During lunch with Ben’s family, Lindzi was so nervous and kept dropping everything, which made me like her more. I really hope Ben doesn’t pick her because she deserves better. Ben’s sister cornered her and grilled her about Courtney rather than getting to know Lindzi better. Julia hasn’t met Courtney yet and already doesn’t like her!
Mr. Smith, who runs a trail-riding operation and captures many horses to limit the herd size and protect the newly abandoned "dumpouts" from harm, thinks there is a solution that makes many people uncomfortable: the slaughterhouse.
Also noteworthy about this Honda's power is that it's not much for towing. Buyers looking to tow more than the CR-V's 1,500-pound limit don't have the option of choosing a larger engine, as buyers of the Ford Escape or Toyota RAV-4 do.
Wenders feels a special bond with Bausch. They became friends over the years, and, both having been born in or near Dusseldorf, Germany, they could speak a Rhineland accent and enjoy their dialect.

Whatever happens to Apple's bookstore, customers should still be able to read e-books on the company's devices. While Forrester says that slightly more than half of iPad owners say they use the device to read books, many do so on third-party iPad apps like the Kindle app.
Having Bush to attack has been convenient for both groups. The tea party movement says its roots are in a rebellion against the Bush administration's increased deficits and bailout of Wall Street firms. This has allowed its members -- people who generally voted for Bush twice and then McCain in 2008 -- to cast themselves as independent from the GOP.

Such pettifogging laws reflect, aside from the joy governments derive from bossing people around, the current rage for regulating political speech lest . . . what? Campaign regulations usually focus on money, supposedly to prevent quid pro quo corruption or the appearance thereof pertaining to candidates.

Hence their obsession with political money, most of which funds the dissemination of speech.

Creme brulee. Once the cream is heated, add flavorings like coffee, lavender, or savories such as butternut squash. Cover the pot, turn off the heat and allow the cream to infuse for at least 10 to 20 minutes. For stronger flavors, Citizen Cake's Elizabeth Falkner suggests an additional step: Leave the flavoring in the cream, cool, cover and store overnight in the refrigerator before straining and reheating. For a perfect creme brulee that is creamy and delicate, it is imperative to not over mix or over bake it. Baking should always be done in a water bath to allow even cooking and to prevent a crust from forming.

Alas, for every chuckle one of the new movie's numbskull moments might pry loose, there is an overlong urinating contest featuring infants in a maternity ward or curtain-closing goofiness with "the Farrellys" (played by soap opera actors) warning kids about the dangers of trying out actual stooge stunts at home.

In a nutshell: James Beard award-winning cookbook author Molly Stevens follows up her instant-classic "All About Braising" with this definitive guide to the art of roasting meats and vegetables, showing how the ages-old technique still has relevance in the era of high-gimmick Modernist cuisine.

øA: The ECB changed what could be collateral for the European banks, which is important. They made what a bank can use as collateral much wider, and they put unlimited use of three-year lending. It was a huge move, much bigger than the market reaction we saw. It's possible that this one thing has removed all funding issues for the big European banks. It gives them breathing room and can help support asset prices in the meantime. The European banks are still being forced to raise capital and by that, they still have to sell assets. They're being forced to sell assets to raise even more capital at precisely the wrong time. It's not a massive amount, but you're starting to see assets for sale, loans for sale. It's tough. You can't do a good job for shareholders raising capital with huge discounts for some assets.

Gasco's version of empanadas ($7.25) is unusual; they're more like pressed sandwiches cut into triangles.

Hales: Well, I'm interested in continuing this regional effort of building partnerships. And that's something I'm good at. I've done it before. I've been very involved in building across the whole metropolitan area about things, whether it was about the urban growth boundary or building a transit system. For example, when I was involved in the transit agenda, we really helped the mayor of Hillsboro and her advocacy to get light rail to not just stop in Beaverton but all the way out to Hillsboro. Look at the effect of that with Nike and Intel and other folks on the line. So the same thing goes for the arts. Part of what I can bring is credibility in the whole region, and a belief that we are an organic region that needs to work together. And the arts is one of these areas where I'll continue to call on the rest of the region to step up and help with arts funding and support arts in all of the schools. I'm sure we'll talk about that when we get to talk about funding measures. There are school districts that are partly in Portland and partly not. The Centennial School District, for instance. Well, all of those kids ought to have access to arts in their daily life and as part of their curriculum in school. We need to think beyond the city limits and that's the important theme of that whole effort.

Hey, Tony: What are the chances the front office is second-guessing their decision on Shurmur? His offense is the second-worst in the NFL, his play-calling does not even come close to playing to the strengths of what "talent" he does have, he stubbornly sticks with rookie guards when they have made mistake after mistake, his inconsistent lineups have ticked off or alienated Hillis and Cribbs, the team's two best (only two) playmakers, and his love affair with Hardesty has left a "Braylon Edwards" amount of drops snuffing out drives. -- Chris Zanon, Canton

Ms. Newhouse is no stranger to Europe's most revered classical concert halls, like Vienna's Musikverein and Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, and the grand 19th-century European opera houses. But as an architectural historian with an equal interest in the past and the present, she has made a particular study of new construction in the U.S. Because she understands the nature and necessity of social, technological and architectural change, she goes beyond conventional architectural criticism and acoustical analysis to outspoken criticism of the results. And she has come to some surprising conclusions.

NFLdraftscout.com writes, "While Claiborne came to Baton Rouge as a receiver, he's leaving as a lockdown cornerback worthy of a top-10 pick. There is no finesse in his game and his physical tools -- height, long arms, natural flexibility and lateral movement -- plus bump-and-run experience will expedite his ascension to Pro Bowl-level starter as his body matures."
Some of his concerns -- such as Kent's failure to reduce tuition at its regional campuses -- can be resolved without holding this project hostage. Fingerhut also doubts Kent needs to raise extra money to retire the bonds -- a contention school officials strongly dispute.
Coleman, who was awarded a $30,000 grant from Cleveland's Civic Innovation Lab to develop CityProwl, hopes to expand the concept to other cities. She also plans to approach Cleveland hotels about offering guests portable audio players stocked with the five Cleveland tours, and she is considering recording tours of the Buckeye, Glenville and Fairfax neighborhoods and the grand public buildings of the city's 1903 Group Plan.
Here's how it works: One end of the tack hammer is magnetized. The upholsterer fills his mouth with little tacks then stretches whatever fabric he's applying till it's taut. The hammer goes to the lips, where a tack is "spit" onto it. Single tacks are applied to the bottom, each side and top of a piece's frame to hold the fabric in place, with the wrinkles stretched out each time, before it's all stapled down.
Then Damon jumped up, saw third base was unprotected, and stole that, too. You looked at your teenage son wearing his Utley jersey and a forlorn expression, and whispered, “The Phillies are dead.” You just knew something mystical was happening.

The first walk begins on an all-dirt trail at an easy grade and then joins a steep and sometimes slippery trail that provides a view of several waterfalls. The second walk is on a dirt trail to the Mitchell Canyon Visitor Center through a native plant garden. Walkers may choose 5K or 10K routes for both walks.
And while some have Hightower falling to the San Francisco 49ers or Baltimore Ravens, I’m not buying that either. I think he’s gone before that. And if not, the two teams I just mentioned will snatch him up.

A musical producer is to a recording, what a director is to a movie.
Beldini, a 75-year-old Democrat, was convicted on two of the six corruption counts she faced following a two-week trial in January and, under sentencing guidelines, faced up to four years and three months in jail. The one-time burlesque dancer sat silently during most of Monday's hearing, wearing a white jacket, a black skirt and pearl earrings. Moments before Linares announced her sentence, Beldini told the judge she had never been so afraid. "I stand before you facing the most terrifying moment of my whole life," Beldini said, her voice shaking.
"It would be tragic if any woman — let alone thousands of women — lost access to these potentially lifesaving screenings because of a politically motivated attack," the senators wrote.

His rhetoric aside, Bloomberg seems hesitant to insist on that. Instead, he's called for a number of piddling reforms to let the city manage its own affairs -- overseeing its own tax collection, for example, or buying supplies, free of state rules. All fine, but not close to closing the mammoth gaps.
In fact, poll after poll reveals that the public considers jobs to be the subject their elected officials should address.

In Argentina, the Roadblock required one team member to jump out of an airplane and the other team member to drive to a marked location to meet up. The non-jumping sister turned her car off the road at the wrong spot and got stuck in some deep sand. She had to wait for friendly locals to drive past and tow her car out. If not for the friendly locals, they would have lost the race right there.
Though “Mad Men” secured the Golden Globe for best drama, Showtime’s “Dexter,” about a creepily moral serial killer, scored two acting awards, one for star Michael C.

Obama told Rolling Stone magazine that he did not believe Romney would be able to disavow the conservative positions he took during the primaries.
Spicy beef soup is fun to eat, with long strings of beef, noodles and slender sprouts wrapping around each other in a pleasant confusion. Seasoned broiled black cod is warming and excellent; the flavors of cod and fermented soy paste form a sort of dense nectar, which the chunks of daikon soak up like a sponge.
"We strongly support our son and all the troops," said Linda.
"There’s only so much excitement you can pack into one day," he said. "The effort is to capture business early on the assumption people will come back and buy more. They’ll forget they bought something or because they’ve had it for so long, it won’t be as special, so they feel they have to get one more thing."
Sorkin and the other filmmakers are clearly aware that Mezrich's book has become something of a liability for the film and are now distancing themselves from the work. "I know this is how Facebook is pushing back against the movie," said Sorkin. "Nothing in the movie has been invented for the sake of Hollywood-izing it or sensationalizing."

This seems to be the year for passion projects for the director. His energetic documentary "Pearl Jam Twenty" indulged his love of rock music, and now "Zoo" celebrates his love of family. Though neither movie reaches the level of Crowe's standout films — the autobiographical intimacy he achieved in 2000's "Almost Famous," which earned him a screenwriting Oscar, or the what-makes-Sammy-run electricity of 1996's "Jerry Maguire" — "Zoo" is definitely one from the heart.
Credentials in hand, I soon thereafter checked in for The Heart Truth Red Dress fashion show. I go to the show for kicks, not the fashions. The purpose is to bring awareness to the perils of heart disease, but the perks include sitting across the aisle from Susan Sarandon (she looked a little like she woke up recently and dressed ultra casual in a well-worn preppy pink Polo) and Johnny Weir (who wore very sparkly pants and gloves).

For many years, the couple has had a cocktail hour ritual. While White cooks, Smith surprises her with a drink — a margarita, a martini, whatever. He used to give her the cocktail to sip while preparing dinner and then retreat to the computer. But White recently asked him to stay with her in the kitchen.
A wide receiver in football, Grimes has been invited to the University of Illinois football camp combine next month.
So the next time we see the pair, they’re 23, and the injuries are more serious. By now, Doug believes Kayleen has special healing powers to heal the eye he has blown out with a firework. Kayleen, preparing for her unsupportive father’s funeral in the morning by drinking herself blurry and driving her car off the road, calls him a “freak” and a “crackhead” instead.
Houston’s family rejected a public spectacle for a final farewell to the pop icon, choosing instead to hold a private, invitation-only funeral at New Hope, the singer’s childhood church, which seats about 1,500. The Rev. Joe A. Carter, pastor at New Hope Baptist Church, said he will officiate the service, which is scheduled to begin at noon. Houston was born in Newark and raised in East Orange.
The claim: Suzanne Kosmas is no moderate. She's a Nancy Pelosi "liberal Democrat." This is one of Adams' favorite claims. But it's a stretch. The widely respected National Journal described Kosmas one of the 10 most moderate members of the entire U.S. House. Kosmas sided with Republicans on everything from estate taxes to opposing high-profile pork in Democratic districts. OpenCongress.org said she voted with John Boehner 58 percent of the time. Kosmas is certainly more liberal than most Republicans. But anyone trying to portray her as a flaming lefty is being disingenuous.
Still, possessing a live Snakehead is against the law, punishable by a fine of up to $500, depending on previous offenses.
øAs Rick shared, "My partner had moved on with his life. But there I was left stewing, hurt and bitter. I allowed him to determine my mood and my happiness. I let him play a role in whether I'd attend a meeting I thought he might be at. I'd wake up hating him while he was probably waking up thinking, 'Should I have Corn Flakes or Cheerios?' "
Chesnut said that the disease is wide-reaching enough to welcome any effort to raise awareness, even if it shuns pink for stark images in black and white.
The handwritten note, received by District Judge Daniel Mabley just before the verdicts were presented last week, said: "Can this be read in the courtroom in front of Ms. Senser? We believe, she believed she hit a car or vehicle and not a person."
On the surface, the minimum benefits requirement does seem to mandate comprehensive coverage. But another provision of the law works in the opposite direction, and the two have to be weighed together.
When the Zafars began building the house, they had some ideas of what they wanted. "An open floor plan was important to us," says Sajid, "and a first-floor master bedroom."

To be sure, not every store was filled to the brim with people looking for deals on Black Friday. With so many major stores opening at midnight, crowds shopped early, staying up late to snag the best deals. That meant there was an unusual lull during the typically bustling pre-dawn hours when stores used to open their doors.
For a while after Sullivan leaves, the relationship continues via frequent letters. Camille follows his progress with pins on a wall map of South America, a situation that is not fated to last, though that doesn't make its ending any less of a jolt.
On spending, the measure generally consists of relatively small adjustments to thousands of individual programs. Agencies like the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement would get a boost within the Homeland Security Department, while GOP defense hawks won additional funding to modernize the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal. The troubled, over-budget, next-generation F-35 fighter plane program would be largely protected.

The headmaster, the Rev. Michael Brunner, said in a statement that Brandon was the last runner in the pack and that a coach trailed about 10 feet behind when Brandon stumbled and fell into the road.
Kazmi, 52, of Rochester Hills, sat quietly until his case was called Thursday afternoon in U.S. District Court in downtown Detroit. He said little and offered no plea when federal Magistrate R. Steven Whalen agreed to a prosecution request to limit his travel to southeastern Michigan. Whalen set a $10,000 bond for Kazmi and ordered him to continue the treatment he has been receiving for mental health issues.
We realize there are further debates to be had about the exact terms and language of the amendment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for instance, does favor such an amendment but wants a 35-year residency requirement for naturalized citizens; Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) would require individuals to have been a citizen for a quarter of a century. But it's remarkable that 18 out of 55 members failed to get back to us on this issue altogether, three refused to comment and 11 others couldn't muster a simple "yes" or "no" answer to these fundamental questions. These include both Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Feinstein reminded us that she had serious concerns about such an amendment the last time the issue was looked at by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but that she would keep an open mind on future proposals. Boxer simply said she'd want to look at the specific language of any proposed amendment before taking a position, but she wouldn't even answer the first question regarding Schwarzenegger's predicament.
"It has got to be central, that's a function of downtown," he said. "You wouldn't want to eliminate that function at the core of the region."
In its motion, the ACLU noted concerns about how the state would collect, store and protect the personal information that people would be required to present under the new standards. They also cited the likely "substantial costs" of implementing the new standards, and said many people — such as domestic violence victims, homeless people and Americans who were born in other countries — would likely face new, major hurdles in getting or renewing licenses.
The counties west of Asheville and south of Great Smoky Mountains National Park are famous for their aquatic cascades -- some powerful, some puny, all a result of the region's dramatic elevation variations and high rainfall.
Kroeger: This is so over the top. We’ve got this flying stage that comes down and picks us up and takes us across the arena and starts spinning ... it’s just absolute insanity. We’ve got this massive screen that splits apart in six different sections, and we’ve got these ... conveyor belts that transport us from parts of the stage.
"Right now, the residents have no trust," Pippin said. "Morale is low in the county. I have no faith in them whatsoever."
By late October and early November, when the 2009-2010 novel H1N1 vaccine became widely available, the virus was spreading quickly throughout Europe and North America. As a result, many patients were likely exposed to the virus after getting the vaccine but before their bodies were able to mount an immune response -- a process that takes at least two weeks. That timing hitch may have driven down the vaccine's apparent effectiveness, said Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist with George Washington University and an expert on influenza, in an interview Tuesday.
Paterno certainly had detractors, as well. One former Penn State professor called his high-minded words on academics a farce. He was criticized for making broad critiques about the wrongs in college football without providing specifics. A former administrator said his players often got special treatment compared to non-athletes. His coaching style often was considered too conservative. Some thought he held on to his job too long. There was a push to move him out in 2004 but it failed.

Hot flashes are perhaps the best-known symptom of menopause. The occurrence of hot flashes varies in frequency and intensity from person to person and over time. They can be severe and frequent enough to interfere with daily activities and even with sleep. When this is the case, women may seek relief in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In general, the current practice is to use the lowest effective dose of HRT to relieve symptoms and to use it for the least amount of time necessary.

(05-10) 13:01 PDT New York (AP) --
Shumpert hurt his knee in the third quarter of Game 1 in the Knicks' first-round Eastern Conference Playoff series with the Heat. The combo guard was particularly useful to interim coach Mike Woodson for his defensive presence against Miami's Dwyane Wade, not to mention his ability to handle the basketball in the absence of Jeremy Lin, who is out because of a torn meniscus in his left knee.
Marini's, which sells 19 flavors of saltwater taffy as well as caramel apples and homemade fudge, is now run by Joseph Marini III, 34, whose great-grandfather Victor started out with a popcorn cart on the boardwalk in 1915. As a kid, Marini used to sweep the floor of the candy store.
"I applaud Edgar for his ability to develop the cultural capital for … the project. If it comes to communication with funders and the art world about the project, I'd give him an A+," said Lowe, founder of Project Row Houses in Houston. "But when it comes to internal stuff, how he's been able to use the project as a way to access the potential of the existing community, that's a different story."

Snapvine: The company lets people post personalized voice comments to their MySpace pages. It has raised more than $2 million from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and other investors.
His opinion is entitled to change, but if Booker is labeling Vanderbeek “one of the most despicable owners” in the NHL, we’ll just assume he’s too busy tweeting to keep up with the league. One team (Atlanta) moved last season (to Winnipeg), another (Nashville) is constantly threatening to do the same and yet another (Phoenix) doesn’t even have an owner. The NHL is running the team.

In the latest quarter, Lipitor revenue fell 42 percent to $1.4 billion, mainly due to a 71 percent plunge in the U.S. However, CEO Frank D'Amelio said in an interview that U.S. market share was "was 2 1/2 times higher than what we would have expected" without the deals.

Yes. Tom Welter, executive director of the Oregon School Activities Association, said that as long as the schools control the programs, they can still participate in existing leagues and playoffs. Money raised by parents or boosters could simply be channeled through the district to operate them, regardless of the source, he said.
Funny, he said, how many of them were 1 irons. There was the shot at Pebble Beach that helped him hold off Bruce Crampton. There was also another 1 iron at Augusta National, with Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller pressuring him, that led to his Masters victory in 1975.

So why haven't you seen "Brokeback Mountain" yet? The "Brokeback Mountain" phenomenon has become as unavoidable as a military recruiter at a continuation school. You can't turn on the television without seeing a gay cowboy, every theater seems to be playing the picture and each day seems to bring a new shopping cart full of awards for the movie -- including eight Oscar nominations this week. It's hard to find a straight man who has seen the movie and regrets it.
Authorities, on the other hand, say Lowson and his co defendants used 100,000 internet protocol addresses, hundreds of e-mails and other modern tricks to commit old-fashioned fraud and hide the fact that the tickets were bought by a single company instead of individual fans.
Dear Margo: I am a couponer who has been lucky to stockpile expensive products. My question concerns my coupons and etiquette. Is it acceptable to use items from my stockpile as gifts? For example, a friend of the family is having a baby. They are struggling financially, and the husband was laid off soon after the wife found out she was pregnant. In lieu of a gift I asked the woman to come over and "shop" at my house. I wanted to help cut their expenses so the money they do have can be used for other things. Since I have every thing from cleaning supplies to personal hygiene items to baby wipes, I thought it more prudent to help with everyday items, rather than buy, say, baby clothes. Do you think this is appropriate? I do not want to come off as cheap. The woman will be taking home more than $250 in products that are the best name-brand items. Because of the coupons, though, I only paid about $20 for it all. I also make gift baskets of full size and sample-sized matching items from the stockpile. What do you think of this? — Coupon Crazy in Kansas City

The court's four liberal justices all seemed friendly toward the law, while two conservative justices—Mr. Scalia and Samuel Alito—left little doubt they would vote against it. Justice Clarence Thomas remained silent, as is his custom, but his prior writings suggest little sympathy for the government's position.
U.S. District Judge Garr M. King sentenced Lafayette F. Keaton on Tuesday to six months' confinement by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, followed by six months of house arrest.

In the debate so far, many of the arguments have been based on rhetoric, not fact. It is important to remember that efforts to maximize judicial "independence" from the electorate can also maximize independence from the law and the Constitution. Without a mechanism for effectively holding judges accountable, judges are free to "go rogue" and make decisions based solely on their political views. Is that better than a campaign season every now and then?
However, electric vehicles tend to reduce oil consumption in nearly all regions, the group said.

The pope's speech went to the heart of a pastoral challenge for church leaders presented with faithful Catholics in unhappy marriages: how to allow an individual Catholic another chance at marriage in the church (charity), while upholding the church's belief in the permanence of marriage (justice).

The affected chips aren't the main processors, which are based on the so-called "Sandy Bridge" technology that Intel announced in January, but a support chip.

2010 Testarossa Dos Rubios Vineyard Santa Lucia Highlands Chardonnay ($39; 14.1%): The inaugural release of the Don Rubios bottling is rich and ripe, but balanced; well-behaved and showing some elegance for its age.

Only the city manager, Bonaparte, can fire Lee or ask for his resignation, and he gave no indication he planned to do so.

"I don't think ever since I've been a head coach, and I guess that's 12 years now, I've been like, 'Man, we're going to win Meramec,'" Walsh said. "It's just too hard to win it. We have bigger goals, but I've never made that one of ours because it's such a challenge. ... That's a tournament that I can remember going to when I was a boy and watching teams play. It's still kind of mind-blowing."

The Tigers (16-5) have dropped games to teams from Memphis, Chicago and New Orleans. But when the McCluer Comets eked out a 60-58 win, it marked the first time since last year's season opener against University City at the Borgia Tournament that Soldan was beaten by a team that resides within St. Louis County.

So you're British, and you're ticked off that the mayor of London, currently up for re-election, is refusing to debate opponents. How do you express your distaste with this? Why, you dress in a chicken suit and chase a mayor lookalike around town. And you make it clear that this will keep happening until the mayor caves. Personally, we like this approach way better than the junk mail attack ads we get in this country.

They're wrong. The abandonment of the case management system is a barely tolerable defeat — not for one side or the other in some obscure struggle for control between local trial courts and central administration, but for Californians who are entitled to, and have been paying for, a judicial system that serves their needs with modern facilities and accessible, up-to-date technology.

Square Books was my first stop in Oxford. I walked east on Van Buren Avenue from the 5 Twelve Bed & Breakfast, passing the Old Venice Pizza Co., once the site of Devoe's Gathright-Reed Drug Co., whose lending library Faulkner frequented a century ago. For years, Gathright-Reed was one of the few places in town to sell Faulkner's books; until relatively late in his career, Faulkner was largely disregarded in Oxford, referred to as "Count No-Count" for his aloofness and his apparent aversion to hard work. This, of course, was not merely a local perspective: Before the 1946 publication of "The Portable Faulkner," which collected and contextualized his writing, most of his books were out of print.

Waxman's are peeled and served with roast chicken, and Bloomfield's are cooked in duck fat.

People with spinal stenosis most often notice pain in the buttocks, along with weakness, numbness or pain in their legs when they stand, walk or try to lie flat. The symptoms generally go away when they sit or bend over because those positions move the arthritic joints away from the nerves, increasing space in the canal.

The legislation, which also seeks to head off an automatic cut in Medicare reimbursements to doctors, is less generous than a version that Obama and congressional Democrats have championed. The newer measure would be financed by cutting federal workforce salaries, requiring higher earning elderly people to pay more for Medicare and raising some federal fees. But it ignores the higher taxes on the rich that Democrats would use to cover the costs of their proposal.
"Hoiles displayed that rare mixture of principle and worldly practicality" which was necessary to transmit his ideas to literally millions of newspaper readers over the course of several decades.

The national debt has grown significantly in recent years and it keeps rising at this very moment. The way that people get into debt is from spending and I believe that the U.S. has been spending too much. I am not very involved with politics or with the government, but from what I have seen, the U.S. is spending a great deal of money on useless things. I think it is time for major spending cuts. They need to start using their spending money to repay all the countries they have borrowed from in the past. If the spending does not stop, then the U.S. will continue to go further in to debt. With out all the useless spending, the U.S. can save some of that money to pay off the debt that has grown significantly. They can start to pay it off slowly, but a little at a time is better than nothing. I am just a high school student so I understand that my knowledge of economics is basic. However, this is the only solution that makes sense to me.

But this isn't a big problem for larger animals. With comparatively less surface area in relation to the size of their bodies, they are able to retain heat much more effectively. Fur or hair thus becomes less necessary, and perhaps, in warmer climes, even a little uncomfortable. It's not a hard-and-fast rule, but it is a strong tendency, one that should hold for feathers as well.
• Yellowjackets aren't very likable and account for at least 90 percent of "bee stings." European paper wasps are often mistaken for wasps or yellowjackets, but are actually beneficial predators of caterpillars and other insects. Both take up residence in yards, so use traps for yellowjackets (they don't work for paper wasps or hornets). Eliminate favorite nesting sites like hollowed-out areas. Insecticides are effective on active nests, but apply at night or early morning. More at ext.colostate.edu/pubs/ insect/05525.html

But remember that resentment is powerful fuel for political movements, and the fires of backlash are still burning on the American right.

He's lying on the ground, tied up in strings, and I'm not sure if it's bone and tendon hanging from his foot or mozzarella cheese. Same goes for the iron weights in the next panel. Or is it tomatoes? And what's the picture in the last one?

Songs and especially videos were quickly passed over high-speed Internet and mobile devices several times faster than what's available in America. Sites like AllKPop and magazines like KoreAm chronicled the exploits of the young, fashionable and lightly transgressive stars — when GD&TOP and pop singer Hyuna saw singles banned by South Korea's major broadcasting networks, that made for delicious scandal. In August, Billboard launched a K-Pop Hot 100 chart to track the genre's sales.

The town and the Traer Creek Metropolitan District signed a settlement "term sheet" in October of last year. That document set a path to end litigation that began in 2009, and avoided a trial that was set to begin Oct. 31 of last year.

Wornum was also vulnerable because earlier in the season, he had taken a strategic risk, and chose to send two of his teammates, Jay and Jennifer, to the rival Red Team.

Think about this. Barnes & Noble—a company that is, ahem, hardly in the forefront of technological innovation—has managed to put together a pretty good Android tablet from scratch in short order, and is selling it for $250 (and even less if, like me, you catch a promotion). It's not a top-of-the-range model, but it does include a superb screen—and analysts will tell you that's typically one of the most expensive parts of a tablet.

As is often the case in public debates this conversation seems anchored mostly in volume, meaning it's about who can scream the loudest? There is little useful or dispassionate reflection on what this debate is about: religious freedom, religious diplomacy, private property and what it means to cry fire in a crowded theater when that theater is a nation at a crossroads.
Much to my surprise, the Port Authority media office told me it shouldn't be a problem. They added that there was no rush because construction slowed at about the 90th floor; it was something I didn't really understand that has to do with the building's mechanicals. When I didn't hear from them for a couple of weeks, I called back and was assured I hadn't been forgotten. It was just really windy up there, I was told, even on calm days down below. I should be ready for a call on 24 hours' notice. I certainly understood. As much as I coveted the view, I had no interest in becoming airborne.

As the Cardinals prep for the start of Grapefruit League games Monday at Roger Dean Stadium, they figure to see a much more reliable and gifted defense in the field. Furcal returns on a two-year deal to start at shortstop. Jay is set to start in center with former Gold Glove winner Carlos Beltran in right. Freese feels more agile in the field another year removed from ankle surgery. It's possible the Cardinals will improve or maintain defensive skill in at least seven of the eight fielding positions.

Those sums pale beside the largest dues deal that Hodgson found: Comerica paid $202,928, including an initiation fee, for CEO Ralph Babb to join a club in Dallas. Babb, incidentally, is a former St. Louisan; he once worked for Mercantile Bank. Comerica received a cash infusion from the U.S. Treasury's TARP program, and TARP requires recipients to have a "luxury expenditures policy." Apparently, though, it doesn't require them to quit paying for luxuries.

Typically, a bad offensive start in an Arena Football League game is crippling.
Hey, Ted: Flynn must be thoroughly evaluated. Here's what I don't like about him: 1. His size and arm strength are not much different from McCoy's. 2. I'm not sure how much he can lift a mediocre team -- a requirement of a true franchise quarterback. I believe his surrounding cast has lifted him. 3. You just never know how a backup will react when he is elevated to the starting job and all the responsibility falls on him. These concerns don't disqualify him, in my opinion, but allaying them would take a lot of research. I do agree if the Browns could find their quarterback outside the draft, they could really make some hay in the draft developing a supporting cast.

The final word on that, of course, will come from the U.S. Supreme Court.

Most of the money received by the Sports Authority from Xanadu -- $160 million -- has now been spent, with only about $15 million left to offset future budget shortfalls.

Like the beautiful October afternoon in 1989, when the San Francisco Giants were playing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series. And then, out of nowhere, came an earthquake. It caused the Cypress Structure of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to pancake and caused a big fire in San Francisco's Marina district. Brick buildings collapsed in San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Watsonville. The earthquake lasted only 15 seconds, but it killed 63 people and put the fear of God into millions.

Maybe the best we can do for now is to adopt the transparent approach of John Calipari, the Kentucky coach. He makes no apologies for what he does. He recruits players who plan to turn pro after a year or two and doesn't pretend that he expects them to graduate. In that sense, Calipari is being more honest about college basketball than is the NCAA.

Rauschenberg was widely regarded as a principal bridge between Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s and Pop art in the 1960s, but he did not subscribe to any narrow doctrine. His work also influenced the emergence of Neo-Dada, Minimal, Conceptual, Post-minimal, Process and performance art. His deep and abiding interest in printmaking facilitated a major revival in the medium, and his achievements in lithography were instrumental in the creation of a contemporary market for prints. In Europe, the humble, everyday objects of the Arte Povera ("poor art") movement expanded on his use of cast-off materials retrieved from the trash bin and the attic.

Cities and suburbs offer much more sustenance than dry scrubland -- with little of the risk coyotesonce encountered when ranchers and hunters shot them as a matter of course. Coyotes sleep in hedges and drainages. They migrate along storm channels and miles of Southern California Edison easements. They drink from pools and pet bowls. They prey on cats and small dogs. They eat fallen fruit, dig scraps from compost heaps and raid bird feeders, trash cans and bags of pet food.

The benefits of direct job creation aren't just transitory. It's well documented that persistent unemployment results in a permanent loss of output and labor productivity.

The Baltimore region not only has a number of outstanding parks and the internationally known Inner Harbor, with its outstanding public walkway, but also a system of protected open space, both public and private, that is arguably more impressive than that in Boston, Chicago and most other major metropolitan areas. Yet, it is not generally recognized, appreciated or marketed as a regional resource. The area to which I refer needs a name; I would call it the Baltimore Greenbelt. A greenbelt is defined by the Webster's dictionary as a belt of parks or farmland around an existing community.
Get life support, stat!: If "Pushing Daisies" was a pleasant surprise, "Private Practice" was the opposite. This "Grey's Anatomy" spin-off came with great expectations, considering it featured a stellar member of the "Grey's" ensemble, Kate Walsh (as Dr. Addison Montgomery). But Addison's adventures as a doc at an L.A. clinic were a conpendium of cliches about Southern Cal. Plus, Dr. Montgomery seemed to have left her chops in Seattle. See for yourself on this first season collection. The writers' strike also called an early halt to this one, so maybe season two will be an improvement. Not rated; 394 min.

Mr. Obama was different. He had that cool name. He was black. He'd never done much that was important, save give some fun speeches, but that was OK; neither had most college students, and that didn't keep them from being special either.

The author's personal engagement with this material gives punch to his conclusion: "Carnegie's presuppositions also point to depressing aspects of the American system, which values success over sincerity, individualism over community. . . . Carnegie just assumes (unconsciously) that he is dealing with a world of pathological narcissists" -- a regrettably apt description of modern America at its worst.

With 3.1 seconds left in the game and the Hawks trailing 81-79, Boston’s Marquis Daniels was called for fouling Hawks center Al Horford as teammate Marvin Williams was about to inbound the ball.

Whenever I get the chance to show love to a Diplomats member — whether it's a lowly alum like Un Kasa or the king of kings himself, Cam'ron — I'm going to do it. This is because the Diplomats (better known as Dipset) will go down as one of the best rap cliques of all time, a distinction that, at least for me, requires no second-guessing. It was the Dips' timeless hits, outsized personalities and the insane Harlem flair they brought to everything they did that made them rap's hottest crew for a few years. Before rappers were yelling "Swag!" every 15 seconds, the Diplomats did it without the tiresome reminding. It was just always there.

One breakdown by Collinsworth I didn’t like was when he questioned S Kenny Phillips on Robinson’s 34-yard touchdown in the third quarter. It was against a Cover-2 look and Phillips had two receivers coming at him. One was WR Miles Austin in the slot, who wasn’t rerouted by Rolle. Phillips had to honor Austin, which is why he was late to get to Robinson. I wouldn’t blame him there. If I had to point to where the coverage could improve, I’d say Rolle could’ve influenced Austin a bit more and CB Corey Webster could’ve sunk deeper and more quickly because there was no threat in the flat. However, it’s also a great throw and catch as well.

In addition to preparing ourselves, we need to prepare our children. It's a difficult conversation to have, and it is one we must learn to undertake. One of the better suggestions I've heard in the wake of the Penn State scandal is that children shouldn't just have one or two parents they feel safe going to for help. They should have five "safe adults," and if one does not help, they can go to the next.
Add complex brightness. Acidity gets the attention of your taste buds, which is why we like things like mustard, pickles and even ketchup. Regular yellow mustard can be brash without being interesting. Try one that brings more to the party. A dijon brings heat, honey mustard brings sweetness, whole grain brings texture. Pickles come in many varieties, too, and try other vegetables pickled like fennel or onions.

By contrast, on the Continent, where many constitutions date all the way back to the disco era (Greece, 1975; Portugal, 1976; Spain, 1978), if the establishment wants to invent a new "right" – i.e., yet another intrusion by government – it goes ahead and does so. If it happens to conflict with this year's constitution, they rewrite it. The United States is the only Western nation in which our rulers invoke the Constitution for the purpose of overriding it – or, at any rate, torturing its language beyond repair.

And everyone can find medical care in an emergency. This is not enough. But it is a set of blessings not available to half the people in the world. We must count our blessings.

I'm a little disappointed. Like most Cardinal fans, I would've loved to see Albert finish his career as a Cardinal. But how can anybody criticize a player for doing what's best for him and his family? In the long run, this is probably better for all concerned; like most, I was really worried about how much a huge 10-year contract was going to hamstring the organization going forward. Should make for a real interesting 2012.

"Pomeranz is not going to go out and win 20 games. Fifteen games is something I think he can do. But that's still a lot on a young kid's plate. We have to give him room to grow and to fail.

This represents a breakthrough in the long-simmering animosity between conservative and liberal Catholics over how much the church should have changed in the wake of Vatican II.

When the clerical sex-abuse scandals surfaced in 2002, conservative Catholics blamed a woozy post-Vatican II mind-set that signaled that anything was permissible, while liberals pointed the finger at a hidebound hierarchy desirous of sweeping unpleasant truths under the rug.

Cocoa powder is dusted on top, and atop that comes a generous layer of the "sawdust" -- pulverized English-style tea biscuits. It's fattening and fabulous.

Those duck confit sandwiches begin with salted legs cooked overnight until tender. When Bittner, 31, mingles earthy meat with her delicate apricot sauce and homemade onions, you taste her feel for balance and nuance. Ham and cheese vaults beyond the ordinary here with lean, flavor-popping meat, sharp gruyere and creamy Oregon butter. But the real find may be the house riff on Spanish bread and chocolate: a toasted baguette oozing dark, melted Scharrfen Berger, the piercing crunch of fleur de sel and a sauve hint of olive oil.
But there is plenty of music in Marley, including exquisite alternative takes of early, essential songs. What also comes across is how, while life in the Marley camp was chaotic and ganja-fogged, he held to his core beliefs. His songs espoused freedom, love, and equality, and so, too, did his actions. Marley became a wealthy man in the last years of his life, but he gave much of his money away - people would queue up at the gates of his Kingston compound, and they would leave with cash.
Long delays should turn even loooonger over the coming weeks as crews start a project to install a new traffic signal system at the highway exit area along the border of Willowick and Wickliffe.

She noted the Food and Drug Administration has said it has prevented more than 100 new shortages in 2011.

Remember, he drew that whopping 86-game suspension back in 2004 for his role in the wild brawl in the Palace at Auburn Hills during that Indiana Pacers-Detroit Pistons game. And all told, he's been suspended 13 times for 111 games during his NBA career.

However, career counseling can lower those numbers. In fact, it's not a bad idea to start looking at career options as early as your junior or senior year in high school. Check with your guidance counselor about career assessment tools and job shadowing opportunities that can help you narrow your degree focus before you even set foot on a college campus. And, when you get to campus be sure to engage the services of the university's career counseling staff.

Its registered voters make up just 2.2 percent of the 10-county region, less than any other county. There’s a stopgap in place, however, with the regional roundtable, which will craft the final project list.

A: Oh yeah, absolutely. I'm not worried about results so much anymore. I was going through that slump there for a while and worrying about results and pressing and wanting to stay in the lineup and thinking I could only stay in the lineup if I could hit. All that negative thought process just buries you even more. I quit worrying about that about a week ago and the results came. I got a few hits in a game, a few RBIs and stuff. In the grand scheme of things looking back, I don't even worry about that anymore. The numbers are going to be what they are at the end of the year. They're not going to be terrible, they're not going to be the best in the league. I'm not worrying about it, I'm just trying to get a routine down and stick with it.

In general, low-budget films stand to benefit the most proportionately by winning because they have received less hype and exposure, the report said. Last year’s winner, "The Hurt Locker," reaped $17 million in box office receipts and cost just $11 million to make.

The Knicks could have brought their best game to Miami, but they still would have lost Game 2, because they are hopelessly overmatched. The Heaters were sharp Monday night. They moved the ball brilliantly. Dwyane Wade had his legs, that flubbed dunk notwithstanding. Mario Chalmers hit game-busters. Chris Bosh was remarkably efficient. LeBron James had an And-One party.

Mr. Rodricks also notes the Social Security contributions and taxes illegal aliens pay and subsequently don't collect.

Questionable Calls: Kendricks was a worthy pick, but his short stature may not be ideal to playing as a SAM linebacker that often has to cover much taller tight ends.

With a statewide unemployment rate hovering just south of 10 percent, our state's leaders need to regain focus at this critical time. Arizona has to get back to work.

We support each other in everything. We are always there for one another. This news has hurt us, but we are not broken. We refuse to go down without a fight. We love our school, and we don't want to go anywhere else. This school is our home. We love this school and will do anything it takes to reverse this decision."

Yet, nothing would help the Hilltop Margarita, which tasted more like a watered-down screwdriver with tequila.

The Von Bondies last released an album five years ago, around the time that this decade's garage-rock revival was petering out. What then to make of "Love Hate and Then There's You," which mainly flogs the same formula as its predecessor? Once more we find singer/guitarist Jason Stollsteimer pushing catchy anguish and drummer Don Blum pounding his way to rapture. The riffs are tight, but not so fresh.

But I surely left the candles smoldering, their wax, still-malleable globs sinking down in the frosting as though trapped in cream-cheese quicksand as I sped out the door at the stroke of age 16, heading to the Sunnyvale DMV with my mom in tow. It was there I would take my driving test in one of the most attractive motorcars ever to grace American asphalt -- our four-door Plymouth Volare, the color of a jaundiced flesh-tone crayon with the aerodynamic lines of a brick.
Today, the biggest challenge we must meet is the one we present to ourselves. To not become a nation that places entitlement ahead of accomplishment.

Hey, Ronnie: Foles is gaining traction with fans and draftniks as a viable option. He has great size (6-5 and 240 pounds), good arm strength and decent accuracy. But there are reasons he isn't mentioned as a first-round talent. With him, the negatives are a 15-18 career record, 33 career interceptions and most of his college experience in a shotgun offense. But his size alone should merit him a long look, in my opinion.

Given demographic trends in the developing world, the transatlantic divide in immigrant experiences is bound to grow. Fertility rates in Mexico, which a generation ago ran more than twice the level in the United States, now equal those on this side of the border. History shows that slowdowns in fertility precede slowdowns in emigration. Africa, a vastly more important source of migrants in Europe than in North America for simple reasons of geography, will be the last continent to witness the great decline in fertility rates historically associated with economic development.

It's kind of my own thing, but I do look at things like the blogs for new ideas and inspiration. I'm told I should be working in fashion. I just helped my sister plan her wedding; I'm good at it.

Curiously, I know a family that got such an experience up close and personal, finding themselves, as Eastern European farmers, sometime around 1947 being forcibly incorporated into the newly created Soviet “Hungarian People’s Republic.” Be aware the Soviet-style “Republic” has no equal to the American version of “Republic,” for in any Soviet “Republic” the political power was held by the Communist rulers over the common citizen, whereas in America under the Constitution today, (and hopefully ongoing) the political power is held by the people, and wielded by them through their elected representatives and senators.

There's a tendency to judge one period of time as preferable to another. I think it works more this way: Changing part of any system sends ripples through that system. B.C.

Let us review the facts. First, the insurance broker involved had the school district contract since 2006, two years before Mayor Bencivengo’s administration took office. Second, the woman who cooperated with the FBI was a close personal friend of the mayor and he would have tried to help her regardless of any benefit to himself. Third, why was she wearing the wire? This raises the question in my mind of what she might have done that she would agree to record Mr. Bencivengo for the FBI. Fourth, there is absolutely no indication that anyone else in local government had any connection whatsoever to this alleged incident.

During the offseason, Cardinals assistant hitting coach John Mabry went with his kids to see "Moneyball," a movie about a team that he played a supporting role in. The film, which follows the 2002 Oakland Athletics and GM Billy Beane's expanded use of statistics, is up for the Academy Awards' best picture Sunday. Mabry, who is played by David Hutchinson in the movie, said that the team wasn't "test-tube babies" for the statistical revolution as portrayed by Hollywood and that any retelling falls short when it minimizes the role of the team's top three pitchers, Tim Hudson, Barry Zito and Mark Mulder.

• Huskies ready to face Pac-12's new foes -- Percy Allen, Seattle Times: It's no secret football drove Scott's decision to expand the conference for the first time in three decades, but the league's 0-12 showing against ranked basketball teams magnifies the curious choice to extend invitations to schools that have been weak on the hard court recently. But it's not as if Colorado is embarrassing the Pac-12 this season. The Buffaloes are 9-4 and 1-0 in conference. Still, a closer examination of their record reveals CU has benefited from a soft schedule that ranks 243rd among the 345 Division I teams, according to the Pomeroy ratings.

Does that mean obesity has plateaued? Well, some larger CDC databases show continued upticks, said Duke University health economist Eric Finkelstein, who led the new CDC-funded forecast. His study used that information along with other factors that influence obesity rates — including food prices, prevalence of fast-food restaurants, unemployment — to come up with what he called "very reasonable estimates" for the next two decades.

In a letter to MALDEF Thursday, assistant city attorney David Broadwell pointed out that the Supreme Court "has established several preconditions for proving a 'vote dilution' claim," none of which appears remotely on point in Denver.

And Denver does not "show a history and tradition of white racial bloc voting that has usually prevented minority candidates from being elected ..." Quite the contrary. See Michael Hancock.

As U.S. pop continues its march into the belly of the mainframe, the Brits are headed in the opposite direction. In the past three years, singers such as Adele, Florence Welsh, Duffy and Lauren Pritchard have been chasing a brassy throwback sound that owes more to Ray Charles and Dusty Springfield than Madonna and Michael Jackson. (Much of this has been a transparent attempt to come up with a sustainable alternative to Amy Winehouse.) It’s every bit as deliberate and constructed as the digital sound of our homegrown electropop androids, but the target is an imaginary past rather than an imaginary future.

On this night, the collaboration is definitely successful. Spinach, hazelnuts, grapefruit and ricotta salata become a bright salad, with a light honey-citrus dressing. After an initial idea of Mexican chili crab with fried rice is abandoned, the crab becomes part of a creamy sauce with roasted shiitakes and ricotta salata, paired with crispy potato-celery root pancakes.

GAME NOTEBOOK: Nashville coach Barry Trotz did not offer a guarantee that Radulov and Andrei Kostitsyn would return to the lineup for Game 4.

He shouldn't be allowed near the water bottles, never mind humans who prefer their body parts kept relatively intact. Make no mistake, for every Frank Gore's head or Michael Crabtree's leg, there are other craniums and ACLs on which Williams drew specific bull's-eyes. . . .

He did this AFTER the league had told the Saints they were being investigated for engaging in illegal pay-to-injure schemes, proving Williams' hubris stretches beyond what we thought was just a normal King of the World conceit."

øIt has been an eventful eight years in real life, too. Housewives premiered to 21.6 million viewers, a big audience for a premiere, and grew from there.

What I said and what you think you heard back during the campaign. I believe I am fulfilling what I am doing. I'm not done.
The governor has not said what he will do next, but his options are limited. He could try to place the tax extensions on the ballot without the Republican votes needed for a two-thirds majority, but that approach is legally questionable.

That's a much tougher sell.

Then the hitman went dark, and Perry honed and refined his cat-and-mouse capabilities in gems like "Pursuit" (2002), "Nightlife" (2005) and the six-book-strong Jane Whitefield novels, in which a young Native American woman disappears people as she eludes attempts to be herself disappeared by dastardly sorts.

Deputies have identified Jeffrey Thomas Sprenger, 22, a white man, as one of the three suspects and are searching for him. The other suspects are described as black males, age 18-22. The sheriff's office said one was described as 6 feet tall, 170 pounds, wearing a black fleece jacket and jean shorts. The other was around 5', 8", 150 to 160 pounds, wearing a dark colored hoodie sweatshirt and blue jeans.
His future challenges include a supernatural update of a fairy tale in "Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters" and securing funds to produce and star in a biography of quintessentially cool actor Steve McQueen. And although Renner chuckles at the idea of doing comedy, "if there's a great script about a transvestite detective, I'd have to check my schedule."

The center's spokesman, Chris Vaccaro, said the weather service had received at least 97 reports of tornadoes by dawn Sunday and survey teams would be heading out to investigate and determine the number of actual tornadoes, their highest winds, and the width and length of their destructive paths. Several large funnel clouds and tornadoes were photographed and videographed during the outbreak.
"So we say, 'We think there's a consumer opportunity here that could be better served.' We then look at the brands we already have and the capabilities we have and we say, 'You know what? If I can use something I already own, that's a lot better for the shareholders because it's a lot cheaper to use something I already own.' So if we can, we'll do it that way."

We shuffled back to the campfire for another delight from Andrus' Dutch oven, broiled chicken. That night, we drank wine, coffee and hot chocolate and gazed up at a shower of stars that burst between the pine branches.
But linking teachers' pay directly to student performance is controversial here and nationwide. Hours after Thursday's announcement, the head of Oregon City's teachers union raised the prospect that the union -- and thus the district -- could withdraw from the program.
Urlacher calmed himself while responding to that one. You could see him self-check, stop in mid-flow and slip into vanilla.

About 15 percent of the funding is public, he said, including a variety of state grants and a federal infusion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The heartbeat of American manufacturing was flatlining. And we had a choice to make.
The best way to serve small plates in your small space is to divide the plates by room. One dish in the living room, another in the dining room and a third in the kitchen means that as guests tire of one, they'll naturally flow to the next room. Think of it as a progressive dinner, but in the confines of your own home. It keeps guests spread out, social and interested.
Broening and Lozada-Hissom took over the cooking duties at Spuntino in March. The result, a totally charming place to have supper. (Disclosure: Broening writes for this newspaper.)
Treat your medicine like you treat your money, said Gregg Mehling, a detective with the Lorain County Drug Task Force.
Higgins is a true Portland classic. Greg Higgins has promoted restaurateur-farmer connections for years, taking on both roles when he grows vegetables, fruits and herbs for his establishment in his own garden. As a result the place serves some of the best vegetarian dishes in town. But the meat is not to be missed, and Higgins does wonders with its pates, in-house cured charcuterie, and especially a Tuscan "whole pig" plate. The restaurant can always be counted on to pair surprising ingredients with main dishes, as in rhubarb compote with duck, baked oysters with a nettle pesto, and fiddlehead ferns in an Italian bread salad. The lower level of the main dining room reminds one of a fine English club -- all wood and genteel class.
While the Kirkland has all of the characteristics that make New Zealand sauvignon blanc unique, it's on the tamer end of the spectrum. A zesty, flavorful wine, it's much softer and easier to drink. It has a clean, minerally aroma with layers of zippy lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors. This is a crisp, medium-bodied white with a 13.5 percent level of alcohol and a refreshing acidity. It goes well with the pasta and asparagus recipe and also makes a good pair with fish and chicken.
A steaminess seems to hang over the stage, as actors fan themselves, remove clothes and even Edward Pierce's lighting seems hazy and hot, as if the sun itself was blasting through wooden planks in the French Quarter's bottom apartment.

Diane DaSilva, 21, said students at the College of Saint Elizabeth in Morristown would not only be affected by the elimination of $17.5 million in aid to independent colleges and universities, but also by other trims such as an 8.7 percent cut to the Educational Opportunity scholarship fund. DaSilva, a junior from Newark, said she already secured her scholarships for her senior year, but she would be devastated if she were still a freshman.
In actuality, the defending state champions, hit hard with injuries through a difficult non-division schedule, once again clearly showed they were again the division's top team, topping fifth-seeded Scottsdale Desert Mountain , 5-3, in the team tournament finale at Glendale's Paseo Racquet Center.

Districts that collect tax revenue from Harrah's casino in Maryland Heights stand to see about $7.8 million less this year than they had anticipated, but still about $2.4 million more than last year.
"There were many things wrong with Cleveland last season and among one of them was the fact that they couldn’t stop the run (30th in the NFL) in a division that emphasizes rushing the football. It’s a recipe for disaster if a team neglects run defense in the AFC North. The Browns tried to correct that problem by taking Hughes in the 3rd Round. He will most likely start his NFL career near the top of the depth chart with the ability to earn starting time immediately next season."
The development of curtain walls in the 1950s changed the face of cities. Previously, outside walls of buildings had to bear the weight of the structures. But steel beam construction allowed the facade of buildings to be primarily lightweight metal and glass, allowing for more creativity in design.
Farm-related stores have moved into some of the locations that border on rural areas. For example, a Rural King moved into the Value City location in Collinsville. And a Farm and Home Supply opened at the Alton site.

It's usually best to err on the side of caution, so unless you're sure hugging is OK, consider a big smile and hearty handshake instead.
“I would like to think so,” Hawks forward Marvin Williams said before Game 2. “I think everybody understands what’s at stake at this point.”
The size of the seats is not a function of passenger weight but a legacy of airplane design from a generation ago, said Vern Alg, a former airline executive who is now a private consultant. "The restriction is the dimension, the width of the aircraft," he said. "With Boeing narrow bodies, for example, if they are going to have six seats across, they can only be 17.1 inches wide."
This confession business is tricky, however.
How does this revelation affect the 2011 field? Eminem is the oldest nominee, and he’s definitely male. He fits the profile of an Album of the Year winner — he’s been kicking around the Grammy lists since “The Slim Shady LP” won Best Rap Album in ‘99. At 24, Lady Gaga is the youngest in the field. But she’s not exactly an ingenue — she’s a known quantity. Morissette came out of nowhere, or Canada; Gaga feels like she’s been on magazine covers forever. The “Bad Romance” singer gets the 10 points, but a little grudgingly.
The tour that starts Friday includes Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and Thailand. Organizers say Kim will high-five everyone at fan events in Hong Kong and Taiwan, too.
Sharp guitar strumming and a distinct beat arrangement supplemented "Back on the Chain Gang," a song that highlighted the country influences on many of the band's songs.
This would make it more difficult for foreign countries to cut production to force up prices. The potentially unreliable countries of North Africa and the Persian Gulf, Venezuela and Nigeria supply a combined total of 5 million barrels a day -- about a quarter of U.S. consumption. That is the amount we ought to replace with an increase in our own domestic production.
If possible, switch fluorescent lighting with flourescents that provide full spectrum light such as Vita-Lite & Vita Brite Full Spectrum Lighting. High-hats (down lighting) or other overhead lighting that provides warmer colored light is another alternative. If replacing fluorescents is impossible, try replacing the cool white bulbs with pink ones. It will not reduce stress levels associated with X-rays or flickers, but it may provide a warmer, more natural light source.

By winning the LPGA Championship in dominating style Sunday, the 22-year-old from Taiwan became the youngest to win four LPGA majors. That's better than Se Ri Pak, who won her fourth at 24, and well ahead of Sorenstam, who was 24 when she claimed the first of her 10 majors — the 1995 U.S. Women's Open.
"I got to know the guys a little bit back then," Trujillo says. "Obviously, that was a different time. Everybody was pretty wild and crazy on the partying tip."

For a true home theater experience, don’t forget to invest in a pair (or a few pairs) of blackout curtains. These look just like standard window coverings, but they’re lined so they block out most, if not all, of the light outside -- which makes it easy to darken your room any time of day. Add a cozy blanket, popcorn and soda to complete the experience.

"Corporations are discovering that they have to be careful," he said. "They can tarnish their brands if they are seen as meddling in partisan politics."
City schools Superintendent Kelvin Adams has said he supports Slay's efforts on charters as long as they result in quality schools, and not more substandard ones. Even so, the district has fought the mayor's attempt to play a more active role in the charter school movement by lobbying against legislation that would have allowed Slay to sponsor schools. The Legislature so far has agreed, with the House voting against the idea last week.
The Meadowlands or Prudential Center, an audience was hard to come by. So the fanbase consisted of small army of devoted souls. The move, with dreams of grandeur, still has its question marks.

And, hoping for lots of kind-hearted people to come out, many more pets will join Bunny, Bella and Angel on Saturday. The dogs will be on leash, the better to meet everyone, while the cats will be in a trailer where they can see out and visitors can come in and meet them.
"If we have a noon game, we won't be able to do as much, but he keeps it pretty consistent," Kovacs said. "We have so many meetings, we don't have time to do anything. The longest break you'll have is 45 minutes then you go back to the room and watch football and try to take a nap and find something to kill the time. My biggest thing is I try to take my mind off football, forget about the game, watch some TV and relax. Then go through walkthroughs and you can start thinking about the game."
The winter solstice is the arrival of winter. The solstice is the moment the tilt of the northern hemisphere of the Earth points farthest from the sun. Most of the world's calendar makers and timekeepers use Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, to note the moment.

That's the price that reflects the cost of the components, especially the top-notch chips, or diodes, that give off the light, and that's the price commercial customers will pay. But the manufacturer, the Netherlands-based Philips, is discounting it right away to $50 for consumers, and working on deals with electric utilities to discount it even further, by as much as $20 to $30.

For all the trouble that Baltimore Racing Development is in now, the race was at a basic level a positive event for the city. Some 160,000 people attended over three days during Labor Day weekend. The course was exciting and beautiful, and locals and out-of-town visitors alike had a good time. It produced a $47 million economic impact for the city — a far cry from what race organizers promised, but still not an insignificant amount. Repairs to the streets downtown before the race were a huge headache for commuters, but the race itself produced less chaos than many feared.

Doctorow gives us Sherman - unstable but brilliant, determined to be one with his soldiers, yet somewhat detached. And he weaves a slew of other characters into the mix, too: Pearl, the pretty young former slave who attracts the attention of the Union soldiers; Colonel Sartorius, the field surgeon for whom amputation is the only answer to many injuries (Satorius will be familiar to readers as the evil genius in Doctorow's earlier novel, The Water Works); Emily Thompson, the southern aristocrat and daughter of a judge who becomes the doctor's assistant; Arly and Will, a pair of Confederate soldiers who might have been dreamed up by Mark Twain; and even one Coalhouse Walker Sr. (father to the black jazz pianist who figures so prominently in "Ragtime").

When debtors sue, collectors often settle quickly. In Minnesota, about 40 percent of all FDCPA lawsuits over the past decade were resolved within 90 days, a Star Tribune analysis of federal court data found.
The individual rosette is monocarpic, meaning the main plant will die after flowering. After the flower stalk dies, cut it off at the base. New plantlets or offsets should emerge from the mother plant. The mother plant will gradually die back and will need to be removed eventually.

O'Neill's week, on the other hand, was mostly uneventful until stories of his run-ins with racing officials on the milkshaking charges — his third in California and fourth in a career that has spanned 25 years — began making the rounds. O'Neill isn't the first trainer in the Triple Crown chase to have to answer questions about possible performance-enhancing — both Rick Dutrow, who won the 2008 Derby and Preakness and Jeff Mullins, who trained the 2009 morning-line favorite, got asked plenty of those — and he won't be the last.

Increasingly, the world belongs to those collecting capital gains. They're the ones who demanded and got massive tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 on the false promise that the gains would "trickle down" to everyone else in the form of more jobs and better wages. They're now advocating austerity economics on the false premise that cuts in public spending -- including education, infrastructure and safety nets -- will generate more "confidence" and "certainty" among lenders and investors, and also lead to more jobs and better wages.

These stand in dramatic contrast to some of the earthier main courses, such as the well-charred filet mignon ($32), served on a generous bed of Blue Lake green beans and doused in a classic peppercorn sauce. It's crowded onto the plate with a pile of thick-cut fries and a breadcrumbed tomato half. Poached halibut ($26) is a simple masterpiece. The moist white fish is surrounded by a thin saffron broth and decorated with minute dices of carrots and paper-thin slices of fennel cut lengthwise so that the ends splay out like a sea creature with tentacles.

Finally, allies suggest that the gas tax will generate new infrastructure projects that create thousands of construction industry jobs. Clearly, that industry has suffered. However, this jobs benefit ignores the offsetting employment loss that will occur in other industries. A 15-cents-per-gallon increase would give Maryland the highest fuel tax in our region and would cost one truck driver an extra $3,000 per year. Imposing such a dramatic cost on local truckers will cause many companies to lay off workers or join the thousands that closed their doors during the recession. Many businesses are pulling out of a deep hole, but rates are still depressed and the recovery is fragile.

9) Thirty years ago, Haiti imported no rice, one of the staples of the Haitian diet. Today, almost all of the rice consumed in Haiti is imported. Why? Because when Haiti borrowed money from through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, it was forced to open its markets to the world. The U.S. then destroyed the Haitian agricultural system by sending heavily subsidized rice and sugar into Haiti. When food riots broke out in Haiti in 2008, after a spike in worldwide rice prices, an article in the New York Times scolded that Haiti, "it's agricultural industry in shambles, needs to better feed itself."

“It’s a wonderful impersonation,” a critic said to me as we left the screening, and I noted the choice of words, and the old charge against Streep – it’s all technique, no feeling. But this is more than mere mimicry. This is a true, bravura performance – one of the best of the year in, sadly, a film that remains solidly in the middle of the pack.

While the rest of the industry gave ground, Cake held fast: "Showroom" sold very close to the number of albums "Pressure Chief" did seven years ago. McCrea considers it appropriate that "Showroom" was the lowest-selling No. 1 album in the history of the Billboard charts. They’ve made it to the summit with gloom, pessimism ("Every shiny toy that once brought you joy/Will soon begin to cloy and annoy" is a typical lyric from the new set) and a modest, self-effacing sound. Where other rock guitarists strum power chords, Cake’s Xan McCurdy — one of the true six-string originals working in contemporary pop — picks out scratchy lines and tiny, funky, broken chords. In the place of screaming solos, multi-instrumentalist Vince DiFiore blows tasteful trumpet leads.

Gov.Martin O'Malley's proposal for a 6 percent sales tax on gas is a bad idea. With the current 23.5 cents per gallon tax, consumers are already struggling to make ends meet. When a Maryland citizen doesn't have enough money to pay his bills, he is forced to cut his spending and adjust his budget. As steward of the public treasury, the same standard should be applied to our governor.

Despite these different perspectives, Obama presented Israel with a strong case for patience. Sanctions, he said, are "slowing the Iranian nuclear program and virtually grinding the Iranian economy to a halt." They also may have drawn Iran back to the negotiating table; on Tuesday it was announced that negotiations would be resumed between Tehran and the U.S., France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany. It is far too early to give up on diplomacy — or, as Obama said at his news conference, "this notion that somehow we have a choice to make in the next week or two weeks, or month or two months, is not borne out by the facts."
Rather than run a rigorous effort, the state and federal agencies have settled for "a minimalist, 'check the boxes' style of enforcement," the city attorney said in his letter.
MH: Books about the Templars fall into two categories. Some are strictly history and confine themselves to the two centuries of the Templars' existence. Others are speculative and deal in the many stories surrounding the Templars, in what you might call the afterlife of the Templars that continues in the popular imagination to this day. I wanted to take a serious look at both the history and the mythic afterlife and to show how they are intimately related and always have been -- how the Templars became the subject of popular imagination already at their inception, celebrities, you might say, the superstars of the Middle Ages.

Trump's signature line from his reality TV series is, "You're fired."

A bonding bill of $500 million to $600 million would serve Minnesota well. It ought to include support for regional convention centers in Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud.

The scenarios:
ø•He's already got his stolen base total into double-digits - can Starlin Castro keep up this pace? His speed skills are consistent with years past; what's different is that he's running much more frequently. While he ran less than 20% when reached first base in 2010-11, he's taking off more than 50% of the time in 2012. That rate is unsustainable, especially since his success rate (about 70%) is nothing special. Castro certainly looks like he'll beat last year's career-best total of 22 steals. But he's not going to double that number, despite his early pace.

"What's surprising is the breadth of support that these (issues) are the most important to children's health and the consensus that it's up to the community  not just the parents  to be involved," said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo.

Dear Dr. Donohue - I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The problem is that people look at me and think I don't look sick, so how could I feel so bad. My muscles hurt. I'm so tired that by noon I am exhausted. Please explain fibromyalgia. Maybe the public will see that I may look OK on the outside but I am screaming with pain on the inside. - M.S.
Some are concerned that OCN represents an advocacy site and not a news service. Oregonian Editor Peter Bhatia wrote on Sunday that we have vetted their coverage. OCN is clearly a news model that we haven’t seen before here in Oregon. It seems only fitting that a project like ONN should take a close look at it. Ultimately, their reporting will have to speak for itself.
A below-grade roadway to replace the viaduct had been considered before by CDOT but was shelved amid concerns about groundwater contamination and cost, Hunt said. Planners decided to revisit the idea earlier this year, he said.
This weekend, while the Orioles were in Anaheim, Calif., playing the Los Angeles Angels, executive vice president Dan Duquette met with Jones' agent, Nez Balelo, who is based primarily out of Los Angeles.

"They are among the most aware, because they read, and active reading is the best way to learn about anything," he said. "They also are the most connected to their communities; they volunteer more, belong to service clubs.

The most disgusting part of all this is that it took 27 years for Bennett to get this far. Plenty of people — including justice advocates from Florida to Washington, D.C — have asked Gov. Charlie Crist, Attorney General Bill McCollum and State Attorney Norm Wolfinger to call for an independent investigation into whether more people were wrongfully convicted. But perhaps because the people rotting wrongfully in prison cells were simply regular Joes — rather than muckety-mucks or campaign-check writers — all three career politicians have ignored the calls for justice.
The work on the fields brought jobs to contractors and developers. Some went on to create major projects in the Phoenix area, including Del E. Webb, who went on to create the Sun City retirement community.

Describing how she answered the experiment's survey questions about spending and saving, Ms. Price says, "When the amounts were small, I was choosing to have most of the money right now, tonight. But as the amounts got larger, I found myself hesitating. I don't know if that's because of the avatar, but I found myself pausing to consider it more."
Frantzich finds the festival's relaxed atmosphere much more appealing than the typical academic affair and the topics much broader in scope than promotional events authors usually attend, he said.

Beth is initially suspicious of him, but then she gets a glimpse of Logan tossing heavy bags of dog food around, all sensitive man sweat and decorously smudged dirt on his forehead, and from that point on she's a goner. If only that pesky deputy sheriff, Keith (Jay R.

I'm less interested in whether that was a right or wrong thing to do than in whether the strategy was effective. And as crafty and shrewd a campaigner as Obama is, I have to imagine even he doesn't think so.
The three-hour eco-tour features narration by a marine biologist, who helps point out the array of birds and other Florida critters and explains the "catch" hauled aboard on an otter trawl or shrimp net. After passengers view the wildlife, the catch is released back into the ocean. There's less science involved in the BYOB cruise, where passengers can sip the beverage of their choice, listen to live music and watch the landscape and sunset, which also qualifies as one of the area's natural wonders.
But there were no complaints from the divers once they arrived in Tijuana and set eyes on the facility. It rivals (and probably surpasses) anything north of the border, with eight 1-meter boards, four 3-meter boards and a world-class diving tower that, unlike most facilities in the States, has platform wide enough to accommodate the relatively new discipline of synchronized diving.

2. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil. Add onion and garlic and sauté until soft and translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add green pepper and celery and sauté for another 4 to 5 minutes or until soft. Add tomato paste, Cajun seasoning, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce, then cook until mixture is aromatic and begins to darken, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Step Three: Think long-term. It's relatively easy to paper over a one-year deficit, but if legislators are serious about eliminating the state's structural shortfall, it requires permanent taxes or permanent spending cuts. What are the state's priorities? Is it outstanding public schools or slightly lower tax rates? Job creation or happy county executives and councils?

Cell phone makers often give U.S. carriers exclusive rights to sell a model, but usually only for six months or so. Apple signed a multi-year contract with AT&T, probably so AT&T would carry a phone that broke many industry rules. Apple had complete control over the software on the phone, and it was linked to Apple's music and video stores, not AT&T's. When the App Store came along a year later, that was completely controlled by Apple as well.

Let's start with the dining credit: You could be conservative and squeeze out two meals or splurge on a special Titanic Tea for two ($47 per person, 1-3 p.m. May 12). The free cocktails usually cost $12-$15 each, and the free Titanic tickets usually cost $27 each. So provided you spend down the credit and take advantage of the extras, the room cost comes out to about $121 plus tax a night.

TOYOTA TROUBLES: Bad publicity from the recalls, mainly for cars that can accelerate without warning, was hurting Toyota long before the earthquake. The recalls began late in 2009, and came just as GM, Ford, Hyundai, and others introduced more competitive cars and trucks. With a bunch of nice alternatives and doubts about quality, customers who dutifully returned to Toyota started considering other brands. Many Toyota models look old and need upgrades. Despite rebates and low-interest financing, Toyota was the only major automaker with lower U.S. sales last year. Sales are up 12.5 percent so far in 2011, but only at half the growth of GM.
Republicans said the president's comments revealed his true intentions. "President Obama signaled that he's going to cave to Russia on missile defense," Mr. Romney said. He expressed concern about the effort to reset relations with Russia, noting Moscow backed Syria at the U.N.

This demand for perfection, of course, sets me up for a painful belly flop. In fact, I wonder how many times I sat in my cozy red chair by the fireplace late Christmas Day, after the last family member has whooshed out the front door, feeling as empty as the boxes that litter the great room. Christmas is over, I realize, and I missed it.
Kovalchuk's injury opened a roster spot for Larsson, a rookie defenseman, to be activated. Larsson was a first-round pick last year, and is just 19 years old. He had two goals and 18 points in his first NHL season, but had not played a playoff game yet. Larsson's shot from the circle beat Bryzgalov on his glove side early in the third for the tying goal.
The cap for classes in grades K-3 will shift from 20 to 22, she said, and the limit for grades 4-5 will move from 24 to 26. Bastnagel said that’s still smaller than most districts, but potentially troubling for kids whose rise into fourth grade coincides with the changes.

Piracy hosted by US-based sites is actually under control. Sites like YouTube aren't required to police what their users do, so long as they have a process for reviewing and removing pirated content after the copyrightholder calls the violation to their attention.
I think the league is ecstatic. This is the first stadium built just for pro football in the history of California. If you look at the other ones, Qualcomm Stadium (in San Diego) was for baseball, Candlestick Park was for baseball, the Coliseum in Oakland was built for baseball and mixed use. In Southern California, the Coliseum and Rose Bowl, those were for the Olympics and college sports. This is the first building just for pro football and it speaks volumes for the amount of work that went into it. California has been such a great market and we just haven't had the venues to host the great American sporting event (the Super Bowl).
Obama said the change of heart had nothing to do with security or concerns that Chicago couldn't handle such a sprawling event.

CLEANING UP (6): If Beltran, the birthday boy, starts at cleanup this evening – and Matheny has given every indication that Beltran will stick there for awhile – he'll have more starts than any teammate at two spots in the order – No. 2 and No. 4.

Beltran has more than 450 plate appearances in his career at each of the top five positions in the lineup, and he has more than 1,000 plate appearances at three different spots in the order. How he's done at each spot in the order:
The Zambrano saga already has enough chapters to fill a book, which would then be made into a Quentin Tarantino movie. He tried the patience of three managers, all of whom defended his boorish behavior at first, only to get kicked in the gut by his lack of respect for authority.

On the flip side, a different reason I'm fine with The Rock staying away for periods of time is because I'm already starting to remember why I got tired of The Rock in the first place – The Attitude Era, as successful as it was, was also the era of overbearing repetition. Even with new catchphrases and techniques, The Rock has already become stale in certain areas. For example, the “(insert phrase here)? Trending on Twitter Worldwide!” game, despite it's effectiveness, is already played out – not to say The Rock (or, as John Cena would tell you, “Brian”) won't be able to think of more funny material, but that time is rapidly approaching.

How would the club teach its lessons? Would the audience participate? Would they take off any items of their clothing? What tools would be used to conduct procedures?
It’s not clear why older people reported fewer sleep disturbances and tiredness, the authors said. It could be that older people have more control over sleep duration while younger people experience more stressors (jobs, kids, socializing) that interfere with sleep. It’s also possible that older people are just more accepting of sleep quality and don’t complain about it as much.

If a politician changes his position — but not the philosophy behind it — it may simply be an evolution of thought. People can and should grow. I certainly hope that one of my least favorite politicians, the late West Virginia Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd, changed his positions from what they were when he created a wing of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s.

It might be useful to take a step back in understanding that the site of the Battle of Princeton counterattack was envisioned from the beginning to be a vital part of Princeton Battlefield State Park. In 1944, C.S. Sincerbeaux prepared a map showing Washington’s counterattack on what is now the proposed faculty housing site. This map became the basis for Gov. Walter Edge’s park boundary lines. The Institute for Advanced Study received a copy of the map and indicated that it was favorably disposed to working with the governor in putting the park together. Then, in 1945, the institute purchased 129.99 acres from Robert Maxwell, including the site of the counterattack — a site that Gov. Edge passionately wanted to be in the park. In 1947, Mr. Maxell and Mrs. Agnes Pyne Hudson both gave property to the park; other parcels were purchased, some acquired under the threat of eminent domain.

Same-sex relationships exist. Parents already have to navigate conversations about Johnny's two dads and why two women live together next door or why two men are holding hands at the market. The conversations can be just as awkward as explaining why Macy doesn't live with both her parents anymore, and why Macy and her mom are no longer free for play dates because her mom has to work more now that her dad has left. And parents are grappling with decisions about sleepovers between their high school daughter and their daughter's lesbian friend.

Meanwhile in Washington, the just-passed liquor law there privatizing liquor sales and ending the state's liquor monopoly is being challenged. Get this: Desperate to get their way and unable to successfully fight the merits of privatization with scare tactics, the initiative's opponents are saying the law voters approved in November violates the single-subject rule for legislative bills and ballot initiatives under the Washington Constitution. The state's constitution says no bill "shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title."
My aunt was a high school field hockey coach, and I remember seeing her coach some games and looking at the goalie and what they have to wear. I was like, "Who would every want to be a goalie?

The Question: I will soon receive a low six-figure inheritance, and I hope to invest most of it. The question is: in what? Most of my financial portfolio is held by a major brokerage house with accounts in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Simply put, I'm a bit skittish in having just one broker handling all of my investments. Naturally, I can simply find another broker with a different firm, cross my fingers and hope for the best. Might there be another suggestion?
The biggest cheer after Alomar popped out of the dugout went to Browns president Mike Holmgren, who was sitting behind the Indians dugout and popped up, larger than life, on the Jumbotron in the middle of the fifth inning. Facing their own eternal rebuilding, the Browns might find the cheers last only until fans see quarterback question marks Jake Delhomme or Seneca Wallace throw a pass.

Mother's Day is the perfect time to pause and celebrate not only our mothers but also the generosity of our community and how the Pacifica Resource Center helps spread that generosity to those that need it most. Now is the perfect time to reflect on the sobering fact that one in ten Pacificans earns less than $25,000 a year, and 1 in 4 Pacificans are eligible for — but in many cases do not receive — public and private benefits, such as CalFresh (California's food stamp program), utility assistance, and housing or child care subsidies.

"The first LTRO was essentially to get rid of the wall of banking debt," Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said in an interview. "The second LTRO will be more about lending, as it could bring enough funds for banks to be proactive."
The jobs bill could help small businesses invest and grow. It would cut the payroll tax in half for employers, and make it easier for businesses to hire. And it would create jobs, building roads and bridges (if we don't stay on top of our roads and bridges it will cost even more money in the end) while preventing up to 280,000 teachers from being laid off. Who would not want to see more Americans put back to work? Families might be better able to put food on their tables for themselves and their children. Why would anyone not choose to have more teachers available to teach their children? Who in their right state of mind would continue to have the rich get richer and the poor get poorer?

A lot of poorly dressed people used the place as a smoking porch and were chased around by security guards trying to get them to stub out their butts.

I recently drove past the intersection of Spoede and Ladue Roads, where there's a vacant lot sitting on the northwest corner.

Perhaps the most fascinating and inventive of the 14 pieces on the program (the project is planned to ultimately run to 36 commissions) was "I Think About You," Paul Moravec's broad and emotionally turbulent treatment of "Losing My Mind" from "Follies." The piece begins simply enough, but quickly balloons into a ferocious outburst of thunderous pounding, and the final recap of the song - done in pure, limpid harmonies - is all the more effective in the wake of that emotional turbulence.

Turns out, the U.S. Attorney's Office says, it was Tran. The boat's owner didn't want to pour any more money into the fake fishing voyage than absolutely necessary. So rather than top off the fuel tanks to make it look like a round trip was planned, he bought just enough gas for a short, one-way trip.

It took all year to get the girl loosen up, but it was definitely worth the wait to get to this assertive, soulful reading of a Dusty Springfield classic served with sass we'd never seen from Cavanagh.

GM spokesman Selim Bingol and Treasury Department spokesman Mark Paustenbach would not comment on any possible price increases.
A senior BP executive, Lamar McKay, cautioned, "It's inappropriate to draw any conclusions before all the facts are known." But the documents established the firmest evidence to date of the sequence of catastrophic events that led to the explosion and worsening spill, a series of failures more reminiscent of the loss of the space shuttle Challenger than the wreck of the Exxon Valdez.
The increased scrutiny may have cut the costs to taxpayers, but it hasn’t entirely eliminated them.
"It is pitiful to see a president defending ideas that are in contradiction with the policies of his first presidency," said Ms. Le Pen. "Such a president cannot become a president of the people."
But James Harrison of the Pittsburgh Steelers, a linebacker who was suspended for a game last season after an illegal hit on Browns quarterback Colt McCoy, tweeted that the penalties were "ridiculous" and suggested that Goodell's crackdown is motivated by the concussion lawsuits and a desire to increase the regular season to 18 games.
The last two segments of "Walker Evans" may be the most interesting, simply because they deal with relatively little-known work from Evans' later years. As an editor at Fortune, Evans made thousands of images of the American scene, but these images -- unlike his earlier work -- were in color. And because they were intended for magazine use, Evans rarely made prints. As a result, this period is represented in the show by the actual magazines.
"Of all the directors I've ever worked with, he's the smartest, quickest and most encouraging. . . . 'Faust' can be so tidal, but this is a juggernaut -- it moves constantly. It helps the audience stay engaged with it."
It's not just a Generation Y problem. According to the New York Fed's report, 5.3 percent of the 37 million borrowers are age 60 and over, and another 11.8 percent are 50 to 59. This doesn't necessarily mean that boomers are going back to school (or still paying off their loans from the 1970s). Rather, it may be one sign that parents are increasingly taking out loans to pay for their kids' educations. According to a February report from the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, 17 percent of parents whose children graduated in 2010 took out loans, up from 5.6 percent in 1992-93.
A Try to avoid incorporating everything you see on HGTV: the granite countertops, stainless-steel appliances, vessel sink. It is your home, and style is pretty personal, but the less gew-gaws, shine and pattern, the better the house looks and the better for resale. The person who wants everything glitzy and high-end is not going to appreciate your house.

The ethanol industry argues such scenarios are unlikely, but farmers have the backing of food manufacturers, who also fear that a federal mandate to increase production of ethanol will protect that industry from any kind of rationing amid a corn shortage.
TUALATIN -- Kyle Singler has shown that he can swish a jump shot from one side of a college swimming pool to the other after leaping from the high dive. He's proven that he can sink shots from the rafters inside Cameron Indoor Stadium.

"Is it unusual at one stage of the litigation to provide support for one side and at another stage of the litigation to provide support for the other side? Yes, it is unusual. I don't see anything unlawful in it."
Sotterley is older than Mt. Vernon. The first owner was Londoner James Bowles, who had the buildings built on his property in 1703. Though the lower Patuxent seems far from the bustle of Annapolis, Baltimore and Washington, we have to remember that in early Colonial times, that's where the action was, and until 1695, the capital of Maryland was St. Mary's City.
Aeriel said the six assailants confronted her group after 11 p.m. and pulled out guns. They ordered the four friends to the ground and stole their possessions, she said. Then two of the assailants began groping her and she was attacked with the machete, she said.

Do you think you're getting that shiny new exercise bike you asked for? Or maybe it's "Just Dance 3," the super-fun new Wii workout, that you want? And did you just blast in from your daily walk, rosy-cheeked and ready to rip?
"People Meters changed things, but February, May and November still seem to be most important," said Shawn Bartelt, general manager of ABC affiliate WFTV-Channel 9. "It's because for all of the networks, almost every episode is fresh. You're not in reruns. Just about all of your syndicated programming is fresh: 'Dr. Oz,' 'Judge Judy.' If you're looking for apples to apples what's going on, you get that picture better in November, February and May."

Schultz bought the patent for the garment and made it the foundation for Alignmed.
Consider some of the things that will happen in the coming year:
Is there a better symbol of willed American decline? The pity is not Discovery's retirement -- beautiful as it was, the shuttle proved too expensive and risky to operate -- but that it died without a successor. The planned follow-on -- the Constellation rocket-capsule program to take humans back into orbit and from there to the moon -- was suddenly canceled in 2010. And with that, control of manned spaceflight was gratuitously ceded to Russia and China.

"They've got a lot of good players up front, some skill, nobody you're necessarily going to key on like some teams have, but they definitely have some threats up front that you have to be aware of," Detroit defenseman Brad Stuart said. "When you can have that threat of multiple guys being able to score, it's more effective than just having one guy. They've been getting timely goals from everybody and that's the key to success through a long season."
Myers notes there's still not a lot of evidence of cord-cutting, or people canceling subscriptions and just watching for free. "Yes, people want to watch content in all these places. There's a push by operators to offer more content online (with the cable industry's vaunted TV Everywhere concept), but you have to keep your subscription to do it."
“Yes. I PRESSED ON and look – still off.”
"If you're a female at this age, it's not very acceptable to be competitive," James said. "For many, many years I didn't think I was a competitive person — not just in running, but in anything. Then one day I said to myself: 'You know, I am competitive. It's probably just with myself, but yeah, I am competitive.' "
I've already learned, for instance, that they wrestle pigs in the mud as part of the fun at the Edwards County Fair. We have just begun to uncover things like this and what else there is to see and do in this newly acquired territory.

Swift didn't get a chance to respond until later, when Beyonce, who won best video of the year, invited Swift on stage to finish her speech. Later, Swift said, "I was standing on stage and I was really excited because I'd just won the award and then I was really excited because Kanye West was on stage. And then I wasn't excited anymore after that."
"Today's action could -- and should -- have gone further," said Michael Copps, one of the other two Democrats on the commission. But, he added, the regulations do represent some progress "to put consumers -- not Big Phone or Big Cable -- in control of their online experiences."

Carl Meacham, a top staffer of the Republican minority at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the conference that the Obama administration's handling of the Rousseff visit reflects the fact that -- despite Brazil's status as the world's sixth-largest economy and its recent discovery of massive oil reserves -- "Brazil is not viewed as a first- or second-tier issue for U.S. foreign policy within the White House."

And it's not just in high-end dining establishments, or in haute cuisine preparations. "Your neighborhood restaurants, you'll see a lot of them trying to incorporate more local products," Wong notes. In the resorts, a new wave of homegrown chefs has also transformed menus, bringing the hearty plantation-era food lovingly profiled in "Kau Kau" onto diners' plates in innovative, and sometimes healthier, ways.
Willoughby Hills didn't give itself enough credit after smoothing out White Road. Crews left a pair of orange "BUMP" advisories alongside fresh pavement on White just east of Bishop Road in Lake County, reports column correspondent Arline Debelak Price. (A complaint about there not being bump? Now there's a Road Rant first.)
"Instead of giving rebuttals and prebuttals to Obama's speeches, Romney can give serious speeches about the Constitution and the Supreme Court, the case for limited government and the threat of bankruptcy and penury, about undoing Obamacare and what will replace it," Kristol wrote.

"True Grit" is best known as the movie that won John Wayne his one and only Academy Award, but truth be told, it's not all that great of a film. Oh, sure, Wayne is very good as Rooster Cogburn, a deputy U.S. Marshal hunter hired by a precocious 14-year-old girl to track down her father's killer.
Upcoming purchases range from the utilitarian -- mobile computers and software-- to the cosmetic -- a standardized paint scheme for patrol cars.
In fairness, the governor and his fellow Republicans are, with good intentions, trying to do two things at once: deploy public resources, but set up a private structure to do the job. Neither goal is likely to be well and truly accomplished.

Matheny said: "There's no question there's been change. And after a team finished like they did, I'm sure nobody was looking for change. It's a cliche, but with change comes opportunity. There was an opportunity that put me in this position, and an opportunity that has promoted Derek Lilliquist as pitching coach. I just don't get too caught up in it. New things arise all the time, and I don't think it will ever stop."

The Heat have outscored the Knicks by an average of 97-77 in what could go down as one of the most lopsided sweeps ever if Miami finishes it off Sunday. Orlando beat Atlanta by 25.3 per game in a 2010 second-round series, and the only other four-game sweep with an average margin of more than 20, according to STATS, LLC, was when the Lakers routed San Antonio by 22.3 per game in the 2001 Western Conference finals.

"According to new information brought to my attention, some witnesses now suggest that the versions of events attributed to them in CPD reports from 2004 were not accurate, including one witness who now claims that his observations during one of the lineups conducted were not accurately memorialized in police reports," Alvarez wrote. "To be clear, at this point, I have no objective evidence to support the notion that there was any misfeasance or malfeasance on the part of investigators in this case. However, with this new information, it is my belief that an independent investigation from a separate police agency is clearly warranted to ensure that we reach the truth in this case."
Uriel is a difficult man in his own way — he likes telling students that their work has things in it that are new and correct, "only the new things are not correct and the correct things are not new" — but, in conversations with both his wife, Dikla (Alma Zak), and his long-suffering mother, Yehudit (Alisa Rosen), it's clear that he cares more about the father-son relationship than the older man does.

Nor should equal justice for everyone be an issue subject to the usual political horse-trading and back-scratching that goes on in Annapolis. This is different from a simple "vote for the road project in my district, and I'll vote for yours" sort of transaction. The gay marriage issue goes to the heart of values that both advocates and opponents consider fundamental, and it shouldn't be an excuse for lawmakers to swap their votes and their principles to advance ancillary causes, no matter how worthy.

I remember that Jesus took a moment to sit with a woman at a well, and that pointed her toward living water. In her excitement, she ran and told all people about the one she had met. I imagine she was filled with gratitude.
I contacted Hotwire and asked it if it was sure about the rating. A representative called you and told you they'd reviewed the Hacienda's rating, and decided it no longer warranted four stars.

He said the planning commission's decision on the project can and most likely will be appealed to the county Board of Zoning Appeals. That decision, in turn, can be appealed to the Circuit Court.

Danny Knobler, CBSSports.com: "So you still don't believe Ryan Braun? Sorry, I can't help you. So you're now claiming that the process is rigged, or that baseball didn't really want Braun suspended? Sorry, can't help you. Go ahead and tell me that it's ‘corrupt,' as one Twitter follower wrote after Thursday's decision was announced in Braun's favor. Go ahead and call him a ‘coward,' as another tweeter said. Sorry, can't help you, because in that case you're not interested in justice. And as for the idea that one not-guilty verdict taints other positive tests, seriously? When one criminal trial ends with not-guilty, do we empty the jails because every other conviction must be wrong, too? If baseball or any other sport is going to have a drug-testing system, there needs to be a way for a player to appeal a positive test. If there's going to be an appeal process, it needs to be fair enough that if the player makes a legitimate case that the test was flawed, he gets off."

If you're going to make that decision -- and sign your name to it -- you'd want to able to justify it to yourself. Kitzhaber decided he couldn't do that, writing, "The single-best indicator of who will and will not be executed has nothing to do with the circumstances of a crime or the findings of a jury. The factor that determines whether someone sentenced to death in Oregon is actually executed is that they volunteer. That is a perversion of justice."

I’ll let Contra Costa coach Alonzo Carter state my case for Goins seeing time this fall: “You don’t recruit a JUCO guy to redshirt. You recruit a JUCO guy to play.” In Goins – no relation to Kenneth – the Terps landed a cornerback with solid size and speed coming off one of the best junior college seasons of any defensive back in California. Goins, who chose the Terps over Idaho, New Mexico State and San Jose State, should provide depth for a Maryland secondary that lost cornerbacks Cameron Chism and Trenton Hughes to graduation.

The flush of young romance is full of strange, powerful new feelings, which can come to somehow deeply define a person for years. In "Goodbye First Love," the third feature from French writer-director Mia Hansen-Løve, a teenage girl struggles to move on after her boyfriend leaves for an extended trip to South America. Years go by and still she cannot shake her feelings for him even as she starts her adult life with a new relationship. When he reappears, the low flame of her dormant passion reignites.

A trial court ruled Avalon had taken control of the lot in 1962, but an appellate court reversed that decision in 2007. The following year, the borough admitted it took the property in 1962, but said it didn’t owe the Klumpps any money because the statute of limitations had expired.
Panetta reminded troops that they are representing the American people and they must live up to strict military standards. “These days, it takes only seconds for one picture to suddenly become an international headline,” the former California congressman said, standing in front of one of the most battle-hardened units in the Army, the “Hammer brigade” of the 3rd Infantry Division.
* If the Cardinals (as expected) close on that long-term contract extension with Molina, the price will be high but it's a positive move for the team and the future. Molina is more than just an elite catcher. He's a big part of the Cardinals' spine. He's a big part of the team's collective competitive personality. Pitchers hold Yadi in such high regard, it's like having a coach behind the plate.
 Next season: It will be easier to establish a rotation after a full offseason and training camp. And he'll have to figure out how to improve the defense after another down year at that end of the court.
While tourism has increased globally over the last decade, the U.S. slice of those travelers has fallen, due in large part to complicated visa procedures and heightened security that followed the Sept. 11 attacks. The 10 years after the attacks are often referred to as the "lost decade" for U.S. tourism, because new procedures drove millions of international travelers to other countries.

not only the first sub.-500 team to make the playoffs but the first to win a game. But now it goes on the road, where it's 2-6 and wasn't competitive in its losses - the closest was a 15-point defeat. But 1 of the road wins came vs. the Bears, who were unbalanced - 39 passes, 17 runs - and gave up 6 sacks in that Oct.

In person, she compensated with charm - all heavy-lidded eyes, smoldering heartache and operatic warbling served with a knowing smirk. The gaggle of photographers in the front row hardly fazed her, nor did the presence of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak handing out business cards at the side of the stage. Backed by a pianist and guitar player, Del Rey casually draped her smoky voice around the longing themes of songs like "Born to Die" and "Blue Jeans" as if she had been singing them forever.

The problems started with an unusual accumulation of ice crystals in the airplane's three pitot tubes, probes that measure speed by capturing the pressure of the oncoming air. Losing reliable airspeed information, the autopilot turned the airplane over to its human minders, as it was designed to do. For some reason -- perhaps he thought the speed was too high -- the pilot who was flying the airplane pulled it up into a climb, rapidly gaining several thousand feet. This in turn led to an aggravated stall.
So it's trying something it is calling the Christmas Price Guarantee. It works this way: If you buy something at Wal-Mart from Nov. 1 to Dec. 25 and find the identical product elsewhere for less, you get a gift card in the amount of the difference.

Rather than ignore the rantings of just one of its 30,000 employees, Goldman put its communications machine into over-drive. A memo from CEO Lloyd Blankfein even outlined the fact that 89 percent of the 85 percent of Goldman employees who responded to a company survey said they believe the firm provides excellent service to its clients. Huh? By my math that means 25 percent of Goldmanites don’t believe that to be the case, or were too lazy to vote. No matter, the firm continued its pattern of protesting too much.
Wilson left an 0-1 pitch up in the zone and Renteria made him pay for the mistake by driving it into the left-field seats. Renteria had gone 53 straight at-bats without a home run since connecting off the Los Angeles Dodgers' Ted Lilly on Sept. 4 and had not homered at AT&T Park since July 27 against Florida's Brian Sanches.

Some of the preparation, including the selection and packing of ingredients making the trip from Oregon, was handled in Portland. Much of the rest, including butchery and sauces, happened the day before at A Voce, whose chef was also named a Food & Wine magazine best new chef, and whom Lightner met at an event for this year's class in Aspen, Colo. Among the work at A Voce was assembling the herbs and greens array for each dish -- a Lightner trademark -- each meticulously portioned into four sets of 60 small plastic containers, each container including a small square of damp paper to prevent its ingredients from drying out.

There's not much in the bare-bones decor and ambience of Kurata to distract you from the food. The folks serving the handful of tables and the four seats at the sushi bar are businesslike and efficient, occasionally too efficient. It's not unknown for everything you order to show up pretty much at once, producing a jam-up that could have you looking around for more table space -- which in a place this small and popular won't often be available.

His rejuvenation has rubbed off on his bandmates. It wasn’t long ago that guitarist Nils Lofgren had both hips replaced; at the Izod Center, he took a long, wild, imaginative solo during "Because the Night" while gyrating and hopping in circles on one leg. Drummer Max Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent gave the impression that they could play another two and a half hours without dropping a stitch. Charlie Giordano, the accordionist and organist who is filling Federici’s chair, had a particularly strong night, adding vivid color to "The E Street Shuffle" and a soul medley that included the Smokey Robinson-written "The Way You Do the Things You Do" and the Wilson Pickett hit "634-5789."

Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi is scheduled to arrive in India next week.
K-12 public education is partially to blame. During the late 1960s, a sense emerged that the performance of high schools had declined — judging from the reasoning, English and math skills of college freshman, employers were probably right.
Although he's known for blisteringly fast fingering and a deep interest in Hawaiian music history, today Makana is more likely to be playing protest music, as he did at the recent heads of state dinner during the APEC meeting in Honolulu, and then at Occupy Honolulu (for details, see my Hawaii Insider blog.)

The numbers told part of that story. In the first 21/2 months of 2008, Donnelly and Achilli exchanged 632 phone calls, a little less than nine a day. Over the same period, she exchanged 425 calls with Garcia. But it veered toward the one-sided: Garcia called her 271 times. She called him 154 times.
In recent months, U.S. counterterrorism officials have come to see Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and one of its leaders, U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, as perhaps a bigger immediate threat to the U.S. The CIA and Special Operations teams have been searching for Mr. Awlaki but lack good intelligence on his whereabouts, officials say.

Editor's note: Some of the best jobs require skills in math, science, technology and engineering, but local business leaders and educators are concerned that there will not be enough students interested in those subjects to meet demand. These skills are vital in Orange County, home to many rising and established technology companies. So, our Editorial Board has been showcasing local scientists and engineers, having them explain their work, and maybe get a student thinking about the kind of inventor or engineer he or she could become.

Next show: 1993, back at Radio City Music Hall, for the first night of a five-show stand. “I Will Always Love You” had become her biggest hit the previous year. Once again, the focus was on singing, not theatrics, and I enjoyed the show very much. She performed just fragments of some of her hits to make room for some more gospel, and a powerful version of the anthem of determination, “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” (from “Dreamgirls”).

Day 2 of the draft was highlighted by plenty of risky business. They passed on several first-round opportunities to land more well-known pass-catching commodities in favor of a highly productive receiver from a smaller school who some draft analysts compare with a Terrell Owens. Then they followed that up with the selection of a couple of talented cornerbacks with potential character issues in Janoris Jenkins and Trumaine Johnson, which gives the Rams the rare distinction of being potentially the first team in NFL history to select two players in the same draft who have both been on the business end of a police stun gun.
The cake layers are all-natural, not a speck of chemically treated flour in the batter. The buttercream has all real butter, and the fresh rose topper is organic and fragrant, a dazzler that comes in many colors. All of this is what you expect from a natural foods purveyor, with polished elegance as a plus. We loved the moist cake but would have liked a spike of lemon in our raspberry filling and a frosting recipe without a slick mouth feel at the finish. But you try it; there are plenty of options, including whipped cream, chocolate mousse and cream cheese.

You don't go to a summer blockbuster movie looking for a plot and you shouldn't expect much of a story from the Transformers ride.

In the fall of 2009, the pair made four trips to Mexico to buy one or two kilos of heroin at a time, Bement said.

The Clippers sounded annoyed and dedicated to improving themselves in the next nine days. And I know the bar has been much higher in prior years with the Blazers (read: trying to beat the Los Angeles team with all the world titles), but Portland is a more experienced, more complete team than the Clippers and should be 4-0 today save for dribbling the ball off their feet, or throwing it out of bounds in front of all those horrified people.

Vicki Berger, a 58-year-old Republican representative from Salem, was one of the 10 tested. Society needs to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of products and seek more scientific study, she said, not impose "willy nilly" bans.
The last thing any enterprise wants is for some government snoop to start minding its business - issuing subpoenas, taking depositions, filing charges, driving up costs. On the theory that the best offense is a good defense, modern sports moguls have taken pains to dispense swift, pre-emptive justice as a means of maintaining jurisdiction. Yet several recent cases should cause district attorneys to weigh weighing in on in-game violence, perhaps in the form of indictments.

What had I wanted from my trip to China? To engage in one of the oldest continuous cultures on our Earth? To sense what modern China might offer? I'd been shocked by the number of old women who begged for money. I'd felt sad seeing the charmless cities where architecture's old bones had been sacrificed for graceless apartments and impressive monuments. But I'd also been amazed at the warmth of China's people.

The business is driving the basketball. Not the other way around. And there's a tremendous ongoing power play among the personalities below Allen. I suspect it's why Portland has had such a revolving door of a front office, and why hiring the next general manager has become a high-wire act for the Blazers.

Though there are many themes coursing through this movie, its primary concern is how anyone copes with a loss like this one. The filmmakers dive into the deep end as soon as we've gotten to know the boy who becomes the totem for our collective pain. In Oskar's case it's the loss not only of a father, but his best friend. In Hanks' hands, Thomas is kind, funny, clever and fascinated by his son. He also becomes the film's primary source of comfort.
The challenge for teams like Ohio State, Michigan State and Wisconsin, three of the best defensive teams in the country, is to continue to lock down on that end of the court while hoping for some more breathing room offensively.

Mexico lures many with its legal drinking age of 18, rather than the usual 21 in the U.S. And tour operators and resort companies woo students by assembling packages that bundle airfare, lodging, meals, access to "VIP" rooms and often drinks as well. Wander into any spring-break zone and you'll find that even the most scantily clad celebrants are sporting color-coded plastic bracelets to affirm their party privileges. (And even if spring-breakers don't buy a tour operator's package, in Mexico they're likely to find clubs that charge $25 to $35 for admission, then serve beer at no charge.)

some expected based on the 18 games the Cardinals and Brewers played against each other the regular season. A few of those became beanball exchanges, and all of them had a certain edge. This series has lacked a bit of that feistiness -- lustily booing Nyjer Morgan is about as chippy as the Busch crowd has gotten so far -- but the Gomez slide and now Zack Greinke plunking David Freese could be adding some cayenne to these churchy festivities.
City Hall’s real estate sweepstakes: Downtown developers are looking for tenants, any tenants, to fill a new office project. The city, it just so happens, may be in the market for new office space. The Bureau of Planning & Sustainability and the Bureau of Development Services live in the city’s 1900 S.W. Fourth Ave. building, a short walk south of City Hall. Portland State University would like to take over the building. So, the two bureaus may at some point need a home. Leonard has been in talks with developer Brad Malsin about potentially moving the BDS to a project at the east end of the Burnside Bridge. The Bureau of Environmental Services, now in the Portland Building next door to City Hall, may be in the market, too. Developers Jim Winkler and Bob Naito have been trying for years to break ground on a PDC-backed project called One Waterfront Place just north of the Broadway Bridge. The word around the building is that Winkler is trying to recruit BES to help anchor his building. All of this and more will be on the table at a council work session at 2 p.m. Thursday. Office space planning has always been a challenge for the city given that each bureau answers to a different elected leader and they typically don’t coordinate their moves well. The work session is an attempt, for now at least, to improve that coordination.

Consider this: TriMet's annual budget is nearly $900 million. At the last TriMet board meeting, it was estimated that charging bus riders in Fareless Square, as the agency is proposing, will raise only about $800,000 per year in revenue. Is TriMet really trying to convince Portlanders that it can't find $800,000 somewhere else in its massive annual budget?

He also imbibed their stories of the slack key artist he calls the "original Hawaiian music icon,” Gabby "Pops" Pahinui (1921-1980).

If only that weary 70-year-old could see what's out there now. Some of the more upscale developments are so handsomely designed and offer so many amenities -- shopping, restaurants, bars serving happy hours, on-site concierges, movie theaters, libraries, art studios, fitness centers, Olympic-size pools, safety features, beautifully landscaped grounds -- that Zaayer wonders if aging baby boomers will find themselves "running to these places."

Aniston, making a small recovery from the horrendous “The Bounty Hunter,” looks pert and pretty (she may be the best-groomed woman in Hollywood — I picture flights of stylists hovering around her like cartoon bluebirds, each one armed with a hot comb and a pumice stone).

“From a fan standpoint, I look at the time when I was there, kind of when Boise started to really build the tradition of winning and started to get some national recognition, and then to see where they’ve taken the program to where I think the last four years they have been a top 10 program,” Forsey said. “It’s pretty amazing to see how fast that program has gotten to what it is.”
Goodell has said that time and again, but the commissioner remains an employee. A powerful employee, for sure, but he has 32 bosses, and if one of those captains wants to sail away - as we've seen with the Raiders, Cardinals, Browns, Colts and Oilers/Titans - there's really not much he can do about it. Except these franchises are running out of places to move where they'll build zillion-dollar stadiums.

Remember, the Hyde Park progressive took searing heat from lakefront liberals when she successfully pushed Joe Berrios over Forrest Claypool for Cook County assessor in 2010.

A study by a Harvard University professor and an analyst from investment banking firm Barclay's Capital found that endorsement deals on average generate a 4 percent increase in company sales.
The success of Barrie's "Peter Pan," combined with the author's shyness, provided an instance of what could be called the Sherlock Holmes phenomenon, in which an author creates a fictional character and universe that overwhelms the reality of his life. It is this peculiar confluence of reality and fantasy, of imagination and reputation that "Finding Neverland" tries to explore, settling, it seems to me, for tears rather than illumination. The more I pondered "Finding Neverland," artfully directed by Marc Forster and based on Allan Knee's stage play, the more I realized that my inner biographer hungered for the full panoply of Barrie's rich life, and that no movie, no matter how artful, could sketch it all in.
The legislation, approved by both the Senate and Assembly, would require that 20 percent of nitrogen contained in fertilizer be a slow-release variety to prevent it from easily washing into waterways during rainfall or lawn watering.

Community volunteers are coordinated through Pacifica School Volunteers and many return each year. Laurie Frater, Jefferson Union High School District Trustee, noted, "this is one of my favorite days of the year. It is wonderful to see the learning that is taking place at Oceana."

I am very impressed with our education system and how it is working. And the teachers that work with students are so supportive and constructive." For science teacher Ryan Reidy, the highlight of Senior Exhibition is to see the growth of the students from early freshman days through senior year. "To watch someone progress from a shy and quiet student, to a confident and animated public speaker - that is the payback for doing what we do." Congratulations to all the courageous Oceana administrators, teachers and seniors. Friday, March 16, was an exhibition of excellence.

"I really have no confidence in any approach that assumes you can implement something in 250 schools at once, with all the blockages and problems and funding challenges of a big school system," he said. "Dr. Ackerman wanted to do it overnight, and with no money. It was absurd."

You could say that Granatell’s role on the show is that of an enabler, gamely indulging in Staub’s whims (including a surprise session with a stripper-pole instructor; “I was a spaz,” Granatell admits) and alternately feeding and discouraging Staub’s more self-destructive impulses, which is to say, all of them.

The unemployment rate, derived from a separate survey of households, was forecast to climb to 8.7 percent, according to the survey median.

Gartland took responsibility for his actions but also appeared to mitigate his own wrongdoing.
By now, you are probably wondering: where is the Big Boi album? Well, it's here, sad to say. It never clicked for me, and I'm not entirely sure why. I always love Big Boi's rhyming, and some of the individual tracks are fantastic, but I find the second half of the record a real chore. I admit that I could never get into the tracks with Janelle Monae and Jamie Foxx, and they're back to back, and right after that there's the George Clinton song that I don't understand. I zone out around there and only re-engage when "Shine Blockas" comes on, and that type of thing never happened with an OutKast set. I adore them to pieces, and I will happily pay money for anything they put out, but I'm convinced now -- Andre and Antawn really do need each other.

Edwards, who had three receptions for 79 yards, is looking for a lucrative contract after this season, and plays like that won't help his cause. The talented wide receiver showed everybody yesterday exactly why he is such a tantalizing talent and yet such a frustrating player at the same time.

Annie is as engaging as she is generous, full of opinions earned by living life at full throttle, even when she was scared to death. And that is a crucial truth about Annie Glenn.

Bottled water enriched with whey protein may be the drink of the future--a painless means of weight control. New Zealand researchers found that even small amounts of whey dissolved in water and consumed two hours before lunch reduced hunger in overweight women. All 46 participants reported feeling more full and satisfied than after consuming a whey-free control drink. The greater the concentration of whey, the stronger and longer the effect. Although none of the women ate less lunch two hours later, higher whey doses may thwart dessert consumption.

If you wondered why the aldermen usually supported whatever Daley set before them, now you can appreciate one important reason: His administration had bought their servitude by engineering pensions beyond their wildest expectations. This happened during the same period when — as we wrote last fall — Daley was consolidating power for his first mayoral re-election campaign in 1991.
In a country that is accustomed to majority government, it is the first time Britain has had peacetime coalition rule since the 1930s, though it has had several minority governments in that time.
"People don't like to go to the painful part," said Spencer. "But the only way we can grow and heal is to acknowledge that pain. Once we stop looking at 'it takes a white girl,' we need to take a look at the fact that it's these women who came together to do something huge in their small community. I'm a realist — we live in a multifaceted, multicultural world, and maybe if we stop labeling ourselves, everyone else will."
“I wasn’t expecting him to get under center. He hadn’t really taken many snaps under center in the game,” Boley said of Romo, who was playing with a bruised right hand. “He started out in the ’gun.

They wrote that Occupy will move into a second phase as cities take down their encampments, a phase with "marked escalation of surprise, playful, precision disruptions  rush-hour flash mobs, bank occupations, 'occupy squads' and edgy theatrics."

Landowners and environmentalists in the region mounted a fierce campaign to block three proposals to build LNG import terminals in Oregon, including the one in Coos Bay. They insisted all along there was no need for imported gas and now say backers are pulling a bait and switch by converting to export projects. Either way, they believe the terminals and associated pipelines will harm forests, farms and salmon habitat.
The city will not run out of salt, Waelterman said. About 15 years ago, he didn't order enough and was forced to add sand to the mix. It worked. Roads were passable. But the clean up was a nightmare. "Sand does not go away," he said.
And Georgia has a law that says courts may order parents to attend conferences at school and to participate in programs designed to improve the student's behavior. Failure to comply can result in fines of up to $500.
Only a trickle of laughter sprouted; most were like my friends and I, just stunned. This was only the final nail in Sinquefield's diatribe of false accusations against public schools. Before the KKK remark, Sinquefield incorrectly said, "In this country, can you think of any other occupation where you can screw up, and screw up a child's life permanently, and they can't fire you?"

When I was a kid, Bo Jackson was one of my favorite players, not just because he was an astonishing blend of speed and power, but because I loved his six-shooter touchdown celebration. Kansas City defensive end Neil Smith and his "home run" sack dance are something I'll never forget. The thought of Deion Sanders high-stepping and tap dancing after an interception return still make me smile. The fact that Barry Sanders simply handed the ball to the referee after a score was great too, because it made him unique in his own classy, understated way. But I never once wished that the entire league behaved like Barry Sanders.

TAMPA — Cilantro is the most divisive herb. Some people can't even be in the same room with it, can detect a single quark of the green herb in a bathtub of salsa. Scientists think there is a gene that causes some people to perceive the flavor as unpleasantly "soapy." Like fruitcake or gin, there's no middle ground (see ihatecilantro.com).

Instead, when asked why he had done something that appeared to be in plain violation of the state law banning government resources from being used for political advocacy, Ekard denounced the question as "dangerous" and "silly."

The problem with being Justin Bieber is that eventually you’ve got to grow up. All of those kids who went crazy for "Baby" and "U Smile" in 2010 are two years older and more discerning; eventually, they’ll be down at the college radio station spinning Wild Flag and Beach House, aggressively disowning their preteen folly. How does an artist who specializes in anodyne professions of puppy love stay relevant as his fan base ages along with him? Has the time come for Justin Bieber to get sexy?
That is not to say you don't get Elvis Presley famously swiveling his hips or Johnny Cash dipping into his regal baritone. Carl Perkins twangs classic guitar licks and Jerry Lee Lewis nearly levitates with his audacious energy.

Training is free and program officials expect to place 85 percent of the graduates. NewBridge is modeled after Manchester Bidwell Corp. in Pittsburgh, which focuses on training unemployed or underemployed adults for in-demand jobs, said Jeffrey Johnson, NewBridge's executive director. Though these two classes will be the first to graduate, program officials are confident placement targets will be met. Johnson said courses are offered only after detailed research of the local labor market confirms that jobs for such positions will be plentiful for years to come. The program also forms partnerships with prospective employers.

The film, produced and directed by Aksoy, whose directing milieu heretofore had been comedy, tells of how the Ottomans' 21-year-old ruler, Mehmet II, took down the walls of the already beleaguered city and put an end to the flagging Byzantine Empire. It's filled with big battle scenes, the world's largest cannon (forged by a woman, no less) and a cameo voice-over by an actor portraying the Prophet Mohammed.

An occasionally by-the-numbers, often moving documentary about the Youth America Grand Prix, a U.S. ballerina competition, "First Position" stirs memories of the spelling-bee doc "Spellbound." The young subjects compete for scholarships and potential careers, and in several instances, the journey they've traveled is evident in their drive. Their devotion to their art is admirable, and the film gets under the skin, if never really in our blood.
Rexville Grocery, Mt. Vernon, WA: Up in the Skagit Valley, the perfect gentrified country store with just-right indulgent breakfasts: Swedish pancakes, Hangtown fry with local oysters, smoked salmon frittata. $; 19271 Best Rd.; 360/466-5522.

Coby Fleener, tight end, Stanford: While ogling quarterback Andrew Luck, did Elway fall in love with the guy catching those perfect spirals? It would make sense for an old quarterback to develop a man crush on a tight end with big-play capability. It also makes more sense than taking a running back in the first round.
At Sears and Kmart this holiday season, shoppers can put as little as $15 down on retail purchases and pay in full later.
The owner of an average single-family home in the district, assessed at $289,000, will face an increase from $173 a year to $275. Owners of costlier homes will confront larger increases.

Roofing contractors all tell me the same thing; municipal roof inspections are anything but thorough. One roofer told me that city inspectors barely get out of their vehicles. I have a high level of respect for municipal inspectors, so I decided to get to the bottom of this.
Volt owners plug their cars into wall sockets at night, getting a 40-mile range on a full charge. After that charge is gone, a gasoline engine takes over, running the electric-drive system. The car starts at about $41,000 before applying a $7,500 federal tax credit.

Her actions were directed by Marc Davis, one of Walt Disney's "nine old men" and Clyde Geronimi, one of the film's directors. The film's animators were not on the set while she was shooting her reference shots.
There were other things too, like Shannon not acknowledging when her name was called, so shortly after they got back from the beach they set up an appointment with a child study team to evaluate Shannon. They were living in Minnesota then, and public schools handle the initial educational diagnosis.
But just because the mainstream objections are easy to dismiss as anachronistic or ideological mutterings, that doesn't mean there isn't an excellent reason to wait.

John Elway, the Broncos' executive vice president of football operations and a former Stanford star, tried to get Jim Harbaugh to interview for the Denver job that eventually went to Fox. Harbaugh left Stanford, where he had great success as a coach, to guide the 49ers this season.
But McDonald County Coroner B.J. Goodwin III said there was no doubt the death was an accident. "It was clear-cut," he said. "We all felt it was the crib that caused the passing."
The turn card didn't affect the hand. No draws were completed, and Mr. E still made a big bet that was almost the size of the pot. I picked the worst option here. Since Mr. E kept in check (bad pun, I know) and so had I, it's unlikely he was bluffing. At the time, I thought he was capable of bluffing since he had a lot of chips -- not to mention the tell I thought that I noticed, which ultimately led me to move all in. I could have just called his turn bet, leaving myself with $17,000 in chips. It would have been almost impossible for Mr. E to bluff the river, and I could have saved my tournament life.
More broadly, worries that an economic slowdown is spreading worldwide hurt all sectors, most notably commodities-sensitive issues like Caterpillar, off 5.6%, or $3.79, at $63.94.

Three city police detectives and two liquor board inspectors testified, as well as several neighbors.

Going ahead early has been a dubious honor in this series. The team that scored first has gone on to lose every time. And in typical fashion, it didn't take the Penguins long to respond.
The Chiefs faced a fourth-and-1 from the Browns’ 36 with 2 minutes to play. Rather than punt, the Chiefs instead handed the ball to Thomas Jones who got the first down.

"Increasingly, and unfortunately in my view, students have been required to shoulder a greater share of the burden of funding higher education than they have since the advent of public education," Pridemore said. "Empowering them to investigate and explore ways of holding down those costs is necessary and appropriate. It is their money."
It must be noted, however, that Lee enjoyed a long honeymoon partly because of his assurances that he had no interest in running for the office.
In the video for the Extra Mile’s “By Your Side,” his two worlds of fatherhood and hip-hop combine. In the black and white clip, Rome pushes his two children — Cydné and Dana, 4 — on swings, as E. Hill’s chopped soul sample plays. It’s a song of inner conflict — What does it mean to be a father? Will my daughters be attracted to men like their dad, for better or worse? — that encapsulates what makes Rome a vital voice in Baltimore’s rap scene.
“Liza’s,” which ran at the Palace Theatre on Broadway in December 2008 and January 2009, was, in part, a tribute to the two women who exerted the greatest influence over Minnelli’s early development as a performer: her famous mother, Judy Garland, and her lesser-known godmother, Kay Thompson.

These turn out to be hard lessons to learn. Obama offered a vision that tied together jobs and taxes, manufacturing and training, education and welfare. Yet Christina D. Romer, past chairwoman of his Council of Economic Advisers, demurred. Writing in The New York Times, she asked: Why favor manufacturing over service industries such as insurance or entertainment?

Overall, the food quality at lunch might have been more consistent, but the workday atmosphere was more sedate. I overheard conversations about investing in oil pipelines, surgeries gone bad, and co-workers from hell. It was a far cry from the party we brought the previous Friday, when our table of men and women, young and old, gay and straight, toothpick slim and jolly round, laughed and told stories while the Guinness flowed.

The president has doggedly pushed piecemeal proposals that he says will improve the lives of middle-income Americans -- from hiring teachers and firefighters to streamlining the refinancing of home mortgages -- as a way to revive the broader job market in the face of a hostile Congress. Romney has tried to keep the focus on the big picture -- one that he contends reveals a president who has failed as a custodian of the economy.
When asked about a definitive return, he said he "was not even speculating."
Dienoff, a frequent candidate for public office, argues that "the city's giving away the store" to get a facility that promises few jobs. The company has said it expects the project to generate six to 10 jobs.

The buzz of chainsaws attempting to cut down the trees on Monday morning drowned out the loud squawking of the parrots that typically floods over Telegraph Hill -- that is, until Mark Bittner, who lives next door and who wrote the book about the birds and starred in a documentary with them, ran out of his cottage, stood at the base of the trees in protest and persuaded workers to turn off their saws.
Like "The Lord of the Rings," C.S. Lewis' "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was the product of a Great Britain that had just been through a war of survival. The story neither was about World War II, nor was it an allegory for it, and yet it was informed by the moral absolutes and challenges of the wartime period: There's the presence of darkest evil, which can't be avoided but must be faced head-on. There's the grim understanding that sacrifice is necessary, that whole worlds are riding on the actions of a handful of individuals. And, in the presence of a wickedness so complete as to be supernatural, there's faith in absolute goodness.
The series was supposed to continue at Hayward Field this year as a coed meet, but UO coach Vin Lananna said logistics couldn't be worked out.
Kovalchuk led the Devils with 37 goals and 83 points in the regular season. He has three goals and three assists in eight postseason games this spring.

But American Airlines officials said they aren't interested in merger talks, and are working to restructure the air carrier and get out of bankruptcy protection.
You aren't going to see a lot of 1,000 yard receivers at Oregon, no matter how long Chip stays because throwing the ball is a change of pace play in this offense. The main problem with the receiver corp last year was drops and the lack of an explosive downfield threat. If even one of our 4 star redshirts emerges, both of those problems should be solved.
Today, she hopes to add another title at the USA Cross Country Championships on the Central Fields in Forest Park.
It was nice of Collins to joke, but it couldn’t have been easy. He’s dealing with a slew of injuries, trying to see how much he can draw out of a team lacking in all departments. And while he probably doesn’t look at Beltran and wish he was still a Met, he certainly knows enough to remember when guys like that, in their prime, wore a Mets uniform.

Two-a-days had been a male-bonding ritual since before the days of leather helmets. But they are banned under the new NFL collective bargaining agreement. Next thing you know, the he-men will be playing golf after workouts, like baseball players.
Elected supervisor in an uncontested election.
A: It's very personal to me. I had just moved in with my (now) fiance and we both started to go to grad school (MIT Sloan School of Management) together. Grad school was already so challenging. On top of that, my fiance would wake me up at 5:30 every single morning with his alarm clock. And I could never fall asleep again. I was already sleeping so little. I totally felt it. I was more irritable, I felt a lot slower, I started gaining weight and was just much less creative. I realized that sleep was so important.

"He told me, 'I'm getting older, what am I gonna do with all this stuff?'" Castinetti tells the Herald. "The trophy wasn’t even in his house, it was in the Sports Museum. If he could sell it and get good money for it, why not? It’s time to make some collectors happy."

The renaissance of Shaker Square as a food destination seems to be in full swing. Chef Sergio Abramof's Sarava anchors the culinary delights to be found on the northeast quadrant. Inspired by the flavors of the chef's native Brazil, Sarava's cuisine fills a rare niche on the local dining scene. Traditional dishes such as feijoada (a rich black-bean stew with sausage and pork) and xim xim(a slow-braised stew of chicken, shrimp, coconut milk and peppers) are as authentically exotic to our palates as they are satisfyingly homey. The "street plates" are where the menu really shines. It's easy to fill a table, tapas-style, with dishes such as tamale cakes, artichoke fritters, chicken passarinho (pan-seared chicken morsels in a garlic-scallion sauce). The substantial and spicy stewed calamari plate is practically a meal in itself. Sarava also delivers a sexy and foreign-seeming atmosphere, especially in the dimly lit, high-ceilinged bar area. South American beats provide the perfect soundtrack for sipping a caipirinha cocktail and nibbling the night away.

With West Virginia out of the picture (and the Scarlet Knight’s 17 game losing streak to them), Rutgers and Louisville will most likely be the media favorites. Rutgers will get Louisville at home and essentially replaces a trip to Morgantown with a trip to Philadelphia to play Temple - where as the road team Scarlet Knight fans could equal and perhaps outnumber Owl fans. This is not to say this schedule is not without its speed bumps. South Florida is notorious for playing well in September, having knocked off the likes of Florida State and Notre Dame in recent years only to take a swan dive in the latter months of the season. Rutgers has not won in Cincinnati in three tries during Big East play. Couple this with back-to-back road trips with Pittsburgh following the Cincinnati game and the USF game will carry even more significance. Should Rutgers prevail in Tampa and knock off their two local rivals at home in Connecticut and Syracuse, they will give themselves a cushion against the Bearcats and Pittsburgh should they lose to one of those two. Providing USF doesn’t win out after the early loss to the Scarlet Knights, even with one conference loss for Rutgers the Cardinals would have no way of clinching before the Thursday night matchup.
Next, at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge studied movement, photographing animals and people with banks of cameras.

His comments reflected more of an acceptance and determination than any real optimism. I'm not even sure there's much to "believe," really. Unless you're talking about something specific.

On Sept. 12, 2001, I wrote a letter to The Sun hoping (praying) that my nation would respond to the Sept. 11 attacks with swift justice rather than protracted war; that we would thoughtfully and strategically aim to increase peace rather than compound violence. We've been warring for 10 years now, and at such cost of lives and treasure — over 5,000 American soldiers and many, many times that in civilian deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars.

If show business is a crash course in rejection -- "You don't look right for the role." "Your voice is wrong for that song." "The network executives don't like you." -- comedy is especially challenging. Getting the gig is only the beginning. Then comes the part where you go out and try to make a roomful of strangers laugh. A theater audience can fake being interested, simply by being quiet and staying awake. But a comedy audience has to react to let the performer know if he or she is doing a good job. There's no coasting; you make 'em laugh, or you don't.

Robertson shared conducting duties for this one-off program with resident conductor Ward Stare. The opening work was Charles Ives' "Central Park in the Dark," conducted by both men, Stare on stage with the strings, Robertson in the lobby with everyone else. The strings offer the sounds of the quiet darkness in the park; the other instruments represent everything from a nightclub to a hansom cab's crash.

"Unquestionably, use of Florida public record laws by the media (in general and not just the interveners here) has become simply a tool to tell a story. It is time that Florida's public records laws recognize this fact and steps be taken to examine whether the laws are too broad and whether the release of certain information is causing more harm or whether the public's and media's right to know outweighs that harm."

The real issue is not his coarse reaction to a young woman, who obviously has no personal shame. This woman is not just a law student. Every since she set foot on Georgetown's Catholic campus this "sexual activist" has been plotting and scheming to get the Catholic Church to renounce one of its most controversial teachings. That makes her a fifth columnist with an agenda and she is using the members of the press to advance her cause to the detriment of my Catholic faith.

I thought we couldn't afford matching furniture or Hummel figurines, and that my mom was too tired to create those snow-scenes on the windows. But I grew up to realize that my mother had something better than money; she had taste. She painted and sketched and made clothes so beautiful that after her memorial service, one of my sister's friends wept as she told me about the elegance of the French seams my mother put inside a formal she'd sewn for her as a gift. Today, years after she's gone, my brother, sister and I have my mom's paintings on the walls of our homes.

Anatolia really comes into its own in the entree category. The chefs are expert at grilling and roasting, and the mixed grill ($22.95) amply demonstrates that skill with a delectable sampling of juicy lamb and chicken kebabs, adana (chopped lamb deliciously spiced, shaped and grilled on a skewer), and lamb doner, the Turkish version of the Greek gyro or Lebanese shwarma. Anatolias doner is classic: crispy on the outside, succulent and tender on the inside. -- Beth Segal
Bailey observed how Groupon, with its nearly 11,500 employees, is an extraordinarily labor-intensive operation. With an annual revenue rate of $172,000 per employee, Groupon compares with the old-economy stalwart R.R. Donnelley and Sons (RRD), while Google records revenue per employee of $1 million, Bailey said. Shinal said Groupon is looking like the Pets.com of the latest tech craze. He said its greatest success has been to stage sales to pre-IPO investors that allowed Mason, Lefkofsky and their venture-capital backers to cash out handsomely "while creating no value for common shareholders."

Heart health: An August study in the journal Circulation found that small amounts of moderately paced leisure activity — as little as 20 minutes a day — lowered people's risk of coronary heart disease by 14%. The paper, which pooled data from 33 studies, found that higher activity levels lowered the risk more than light activity did. But even those who got less than 150 minutes of exercise a week (the minimum amount recommended by the government's 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans) had a lower risk than did those who were sedentary.

A problem with both K2 and bath salts is that while the chemicals have been made illegal in Michigan, the fact these "lab drugs" are someone's chemistry project allows them to change the chemical make up and skirt the law after testing is done by our MSP crime labs. The Michigan House and Senate both have bills that would give the State Department of Community Health the authority to temporarily categorize substances such as K2 and so-called "bath salts" as an imminent danger to the health and lives of Michigan residents as controlled substances. This would allow the new chemical make up, when identified, to be subject to Michigan drug enforcement laws.

In regard to "Envisioning I-70 as a toll road" (Jan 18), I was troubled by the cost of the toll road to motorists. Ten to fifteen cents per mile is insane. Even more troubling is the tripling of the cost to our trucking companies. Did the Missouri Department of Transportation take into consideration the amount of students who travel back and forth to the several universities on the I-70 corridor between St. Louis and Kansas City? As the parent of a student at the University of Missouri in Columbia, I know my child does not have the means to pay $30.00 every time he makes a 200 mile round trip from our home in St. Charles to the university. Did the Transportation Dept. take into consideration the cost to the small towns along this route who will ultimately suffer if this toll road comes to fruition? Motorists will not be able to afford the extra cost of visiting these small communities that depend on consumers for their livelihood. Towns, such as Hermann and Fulton, who depend on the tourism trade will be adversely affected. The overall cost to these communities, as well as the state itself, will be enormous. Motorists from our state, as well as others, might decide the cost of the toll roads far outweigh the desire to visit our state for the many amenities we provide. The Lake of the Ozarks and all of the towns along the way will lose many tourists to other recreational sites in other states. Carlyle Lake in Illinois and Rend Lake in Kentucky come to mind as areas that are in close proximity to the St. Louis area and offer many of the same recreational amenities that are available at the Lake of the Ozarks.

You can see how downtown St. Petersburg workers could use a little Taco Man love at lunch. The menu is divided into ceviches — mostly shared appetizer ideas, priced $9 to $13, a raft of soft tacos (all cheap and on housemade corn tortillas), soups and salads, a few sandwiches, a pile of miscellaneous appetizers and a short list of mid-priced entrees.

"It's easy for doctors and patients to only focus on the benefits of new drugs like Avastin, and to ignore the side effects, " Meropol said. "Even though Avastin is very well-tolerated, there are some uncommon but serious side effects.

øA: You have to have a much longer-term viewpoint. First, you have to change your guidepost. Ask yourself, how much money do I need when I retire? You have to have a strong belief, if you're in good health, that you will live to probably your mid-80s. And if you're a couple who are in your 60s and in good health, statistically, one of the two of you will live to 92. So you need adequacy in your nest egg when you retire to meet those financial needs as you live longer. People today are preoccupied in trying to live a better, longer life. They may be exercising more, taking vitamins, having regular examinations. We do that because we want to live longer. We're so preoccupied with finding a lifestyle that allows us to live longer and more successfully, but we don't take that same horizon when we invest for our retirement. What I'm trying to suggest is once you start to say, I need X dollars in retirement, then you work backwards. You're not going to earn that with zero interest in cash. You're going to need some form of returns, and there are areas where you can earn 4%, 5%, 6% type of returns over a course of a long time, and that's generally shares of dividend-paying companies and other forms of credit such as high-yield and other products that will give you a higher return than cash. So if you needed, let's say, $40,000 pretax to live by or $55,000 pretax to live by, work backwards. Depending on your life, your age, how much money do you need to put away? What type of return do you need to earn to build that nest egg? And I think too few people are focusing on that.
Graduates, in heavy debt, can't find decent jobs. Our infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.) is falling apart. Yet we still are actually spending $3 billion or more a month for our worldwide military involvement. How about withdrawing our troops from South Korea, Japan, Germany and the dozen other worldwide locations? The money we are blowing on military adventures could really help at home.

Hey, Josh: If Thomas made the Pro Bowl in each of his first 10 years in the NFL, that would be a pretty good opening argument for induction into the Hall of Fame.

Tooloulou doesn't have an official dessert menu, but it serves milkshakes and root beer floats made with ice cream from Prigel Family Creamery. During our visit, the dessert special was strawberry shortcake made with Lagergren's sweet biscuits ,which were the size of a salad plate, fresh strawberries and barely whipped sweet cream ($6). The shortcake teetered on the edge of sweet —- some of us thought it should be more sugary — but the biscuit alone, with its tender texture and slight crumble, was worth the price (and the calories).

Late-night Portland offers a dizzying array of liquid choices.

This one, made with turkey links which Hillshire Farms (gomeat.com) plumps with pepper Jack cheese, is marinated along with fresh veggies in fajita-flavored ingredients. Early prep takes about 15 minutes, so all ingredients are ready to string on skewers for a quick and easy grilling session of another 15 minutes.

It is vital that you sit down with a school counselor and ask if he is on track to finish in three years if he needed to. How would he compare to the students in the class above him? The counselor will need to give a recommendation for private schools, so it is important to know if he will get his school's support. If it seems like this path is appropriate, sit down and create a balanced college list. If he will only graduate early if he gets into certain programs, then the list can be aggressive, but don't make this list without great thought. If he gets the offers and instead decides to stay that last year of high school, that is OK.

Unfortunately, this may all change if we don't take action. The administration's proposed budget for the 2013 fiscal year -- now in front of Congress -- includes a devastating 20 percent cut to planetary funding. A cut of that scale will eliminate several Mars missions, break international agreements that jointly support other missions, eliminate any large-scale "flagship" missions for the foreseeable future and force us to abandon any plans to explore the potential habitability of the "water moons" Europa and Enceladus, circling Jupiter and Saturn.

Anyway, as I'm driving Saturday, I'm thinking how ironic it is that my first trip up here was to visit a blind man, and now I was going to see a blind judo competition. In the Whittier Christian High School gym I find Carlos and the third-annual Friendship Games. The tournament is run by Donnand Julie Hearn, who own the Akida Martial Arts Academy in Buena Park. It was Carlos who four years ago saw a blind girl aggressively playing some schoolyard game and told Donn he should get her into his classes.

Gosselin, who has called TLC a "monster" and blamed the network for destroying his marriage, is an "exclusive" employee, which means he can't accept payment from other sources to talk about his situation.

Butterfield considers himself "a pretty good student," currently immersed in photography and music (he plays piano, guitar and drums) as well as the usual subjects during the one-hour-of-work, one-hour-of-school on-set schedule. That helped when Scorsese gave him "homework" as well — movies to watch to familiarize himself with the early-film era that concerns "Hugo," and other movies that inspired the director. No studying, however, could prepare Butterfield for the emotional demands of playing an orphan sustaining himself in a Parisian train station.

One acquaintance, favoring privacy, said that if the worst were to happen to her husband and someone wielding a camera dared to elbow in on her family's grief, she'd "open up a can of Army wife whoop-ass." The image of the modern military spouse is half-frontier wife, half-Care Bear -- by turns stoically able and cooingly comforting. But when it comes to acting on behalf of our kin and the larger military family, make no mistake: Wives are warriors too.

"We want to make sure folks are rested and safe when they are working," Richter said. "When you have too much availability of overtime it starts to burn out your staff."
Yes, yes, after seeing the pilot, the network wanted to ramp up the action. We had a little bit, but they wanted more, which is kind of ironic because the original script had a very elaborate car chase and I thought, 'Oh, that will be fun,' but by the time we began shooting, it was gone, of course, for budget reasons. But now we have another action sequence in the pilot, which I think is actually better. I hope you liked it. It's the one in the gas station — it was fun.

Lucy, an aging German shorthair, stood rigid as a statue, her stubbed tail plank straight as she locked onto the scent of chukar partridge seeking cover in the summer switchgrass.

You order at the counter at this crazy-quilt colorful eatery blooming with bright landscape paintings, parrot sculptures, mural-topped communal tables and bouncy Mexican music, but that doesn't mean fast food.

The U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for the Cleveland Job Corps Academy, which has operated in the city for four decades. It moved to a $35 million, 25-acre campus in Collinwood in 2007. It gets noticed only when politicians visit the campus or a student success story is celebrated.

The poor play, along with the league's second-highest goalkeeper salary at $200,000 (Seattle's Kasey Keller earned $300,000) last season, prompted D.C. United to move Perkins.

The strangest situation was when I was stopped for speeding by the notoriously corrupt police. When the officer pulled me over, I pretended I didn't understand Spanish, hoping he might give up and just let me go. I ended up going native. I gave the officer enough money to treat himself and his senora to a steak dinner, then was allowed to go on my way. Of course, no ticket was issued. It was both frightening and amusing.

I've thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days - the character of our country. One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self-reliance, our rugged individualism, our fierce defense of freedom and our healthy skepticism of government.

And despite the fact that pastors never work harder than during this week-four sermons in four days, anyone?-I suspect most of my fellow clergy would feel the same way. Holy Week is the reason we do this. Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection is the heart of Christian faith. Without it, we'd have no reason to get together at all.
Spokesman Chris Hibbs says the switch has less to do with money than giving game-goers greater variety - concession stands will sport eight flavors rather than six - and Dr Pepper Snapple Group's willingness to invest in new kinds of retail and in-stadium marketing, including opening a Dr Pepper Patio next to the new pro shop where fans can hang out and watch game highlights on a giant video screen and eat and drink new concession goodies.

But take the time to do what Sarah Jackson did when she was doing her internship at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site. The McKendree University junior kept a log of what she did, but also of what she learned. It's a great way to chart your progress and to reinforce the knowledge or skills you've gained.

Jessica: If we're in the office, we start with coffee or tea and a meeting. This is new, because as a small creative business it's easy to be pulled in a million different directions.

Then, there's the unusual: feeding our cockroaches, tarantulas and scorpions. We schedule workshops in schools and libraries, and the occasional birthday party. If we have a new video project, we spend our day scripting and/or editing stock footage. Filming days are simultaneously the most stressful and the most fun. We have to find places to film, avoid the rain, and often dress up in homemade insect costumes to film mating and courtship sequences. Right now our goal is setting up a WebTV show for our videos. We have no idea how to do that, so if any ONN readers have advice on that, we'd love to hear it!
